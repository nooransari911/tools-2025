so 4 years back I made an iot enery monitoring device in which I use a current sensor for that project and at that time I took the voltage value as a constant number to calculate the power but a lot of people commented on that video saying that voltage is something which varies a lot sometimes so it will be better to sense both voltage and current to calculate the power and that will be the more accurate power consumption value consumed by our device so here I am with the new and upgraded project so in this video I made my own iot energy monitoring device in which I'm sensing both the voltage and current to calculate the actual power consumed by our device and furthermore I can send that data to the cloud for further processing or monitoring the energy consumed Byer devices over internet so this will be a super accurate and super interesting and useful IID project which you can try out in the upcoming holidays so now let me show you the complete process of making this project but before that here I would like to thank DJ who is not only the sponsor of this video but also provided all the components required to make this project so DJ ke provides more than 13.4 million components from over 2,300 quality brand manufacturers with product in stock and available for immedate shipment DJ can act as your One-Stop shop for all your Electronic Component needs also with their fast shipping and excellent customer service you can trust that your components will be always arrive on time and in the top condition so do remember to check out dj. in for your next project so this project is divided in three major parts one for current sensing second for voltage sensing and third for processing the data and sending it over internet so now let's see what kind of component we use for each segment so here for sensing the current we have used the CT sensor which stands for the current Transformer sensor and it's perfect and convenient to use this sensor for sensing the current because we don't need to cut any wires or connect the sensor in between our AC load rather we can clamp the sensor in one of the wire carrying current to sense the current flowing in that wire and then to make the sensor work properly and convert the AC signal to the DC one which we later give to our microcontroller we have used two ic's from ADI which is ICL 760 which is used for voltage conversion and AD 736 which is used to convert the AC signal from the sensor to the DC signal and then give letter to the controller and that's how we able to sense the AC current and now for the voltage sensing part here we have used the ZM pt101 which is an ac voltage sensor and it is used along with the lm358 operational amplifier IC whose data is later than provided to the micro controller and that's how we are able to sense the ac voltage and later to process all the data and send it over to Cloud we have used our alltime favorite esp32 Wi-Fi module and as here we have used the esp32 Wi-Fi module rather than the ES sp32 development board we also added the power supply and the programming circuit on board and now with all these things connected together the final schematic of this project looks something like this so after finalizing the schematic we got our own custom PCB design for this project and now let's move on to the shouldering part and starting with the Assembly of smt components [Music] first so after shouldering the smt components we shouldered the dip components and after shouldering them all we are done with the hardware part of the project and now it's time to have a look over the coding part so here is the sample code to visualize the current and sensus data reading on a Serial Monitor and in this code I just ched one single library that is called as zmpt101b whose link is provided in the code itself so you can download it and install it in your ardino ID now let's try uploading the code and see if we getting the actual readings or not okay so here the code is uploaded and now I will connect the project with the AC Supply to sense the voltage and for the current I'll take this small 60 W bulb and connect the clamp sensor around one of its wire and later I'll insert the 3.5 mm Jack into the socket and if I observe the serial monitor as you can see I'm able to see the voltage and current readings on it and eventually I can calculate the total power consumed by the appliances and now if I remove the bulb as you can see the current value drops down to zero that means our project is perfectly working fine now let's move ahead and write the code for sending this data to iot Cloud okay so here is the code for our iot energy monitoring project where I'm sending the real-time data to my ardino iot cloud account and along with that I'm also showcasing the data on the tiny overl screen on the project itself now if you want to use this code on your end well you need to do a couple of changes like changing the Wi-Fi credentials and also changing the credentials of your Rd iot cloud account well if you want to learn more about how to set up your ardino iot cloud account how to write the sketch for it how to do all the configuration well you should watch out my getting started video with the ardino iot cloud which is already uploaded on my YouTube channel that will guide you completely on how to use the ardino iot cloud to make your own iot projects okay so here now I'll upload the code and now let's see this project working in action so here this time I got a 3D printed case designed for this project to make it look more neat and compact so after inserting the project in the casing and attaching the wires to it I connected it with the AC main source and here again for the demo purpose I took a 60 W bulb as a load and now as you can see I can visualize the data on the OLED screen and not only that I can also visualize the data in real time on My aino iot Cloud Web dashboard as well as the mobile dashboard now for the second demo I connected a 100 W bulb in parallel with the first one and I got the new readings on the dashboard instantly and accurately so that was the iot energy monitoring project made completely from scratch I hope you like the project and like the video as well also don't forget to check out dj.in website for getting the electronic components for your next project and yeah that being said I am just ending this video here and now just wait for my next video and then explore learn share with me te SMS dig key
