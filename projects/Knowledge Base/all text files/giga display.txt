so in this video we made our complete dashboard on Giga display to control my studio appliances and also to monitor real time temperature and humidity sensors data on it and all this is working over internet using ardino iot Cloud so it's kind of a mini tablet that we can use to interact with our home and office appliances and in this video I'm going to explain you each and every step to know how you can make it too so let's get started with this video after a really short ad this video is sponsored by LTM which is a piece PB designer based software company now LTM is not just another PCB designing software rather it's a worldclass and awardwinning PCB designing tool that has some features like Advanced interactive routing with auto completion any angle routing bus routing face and L tuning follow me mod and much more which makes it an ideal choice for PCB designing by a lot of companies along with this they do also have LT 365 that not just covers the PCB designing part but also helps with design sharing y web sharing designs to Mechanical team for product design centralized cloud storage and a lot more and along with all this you do have a very useful search engine made just for electronic components called as octopart using octopart you can search for any components and you will be able to compare its price and availability around the globe not only that you can also get the details about the components like it specifications and data sheet all at one single place so LTM provides everything to make your production task a lot easier so do try out all the services right now as you'll be getting a free trial version by just clicking the link mention in the description happy making so this complete project is divided in three different step so first step is we need to control all our home appliances using Ardo iot Cloud so we need to have a home automation project in between second step is we need to make a dashboard UI in which we can have different different widget for controlling appliances controlling speed of fan and also monitoring sensors data so we need to create a graphical user interface and the third step is to link both of them like the dashboard and the actual Hardware that is controlling the appliances so starting with the first part then two months back I made a video about controlling your home appliances using ardino Nano es32 and ardino iot cloud and in that video I covered each and every part like how to make the hardware for that project how to do coding for it and how to configure the ardino IOD Cloud as well and after doing all this we were successfully able to control up to 4 AC appliances speed of 1 AC fan and also monitoring temperature and unity sensors data in real time on ardino iot cloud so do watch out that video whose link is obviously in the description of this video and with that we have completed the first step of the project now let's move on to the second step so now for the second part we need the Giga display shield and we need to snap it with our Giga R1 Wi-Fi board and with this we are done with the hardware part and now we need to move on to aino ID to create the graphical user interface let me show show you that process so now here I won't explain you the complete code about how I made that complete dashboard but what I'll do is I'll rather explain you the process about how I made that complete dashboard you will not only learn how I made this dashboard how you can make this dashboard but you will learn how to make any dashboard how to add any vget how to customize it how to add the events to it sub so let me show you that process so first of all this is the very basic example that is creating a grid object of the size display width display height which is complete 800x 480 pixels of grid and here we can add any widget currently we haven't added any widget so after having this sample sketch with you you can go to the lvgl documentation page whose link I'll be providing in the description of this video and this is an amazing documentation like you don't need anything else if you have this web page okay here you can go to the widget section and here you can choose any of the widget I will click on the button widget and I will click on the examples now here if I expand this C code I will get a complete code for creating a button on my display so it's a two different functions here I'll quickly copy this code and I will paste it above my void setup now here what is the purpose of two different function well one function is used for configuring that button what will be it size what will be it shape where it will be placed what should be label everything will be written here inside the main configuration function then the event handler function is attached with the main function by adding this line called as add event as you can see the event handler is attached with our button one and this event handler is responsible for adding any kind of actions to our button if you want to turn any LED using the button we need to provide in the event handler if you want to send any data to the cloud by pressing the button we need to provide it in event handler so that are the purposes of two different functions and now to show this button to our in our display I just need to copy this main function and paste it just uh at the end of void setup inside void setup so yeah after pasting it now I will select the right comport and right board and first let's just try to compile but it won't compile it will throw an error let's just wait for that error and I'll show you why it is coming and what's the solution of it so as expected we got a error called as lvor screen active was not declared in the scope now what is this error about well it's the error of wrong syntax or wrong wrong keyword that is not found in the library and this error occurs when you copy the code for a different Library version and inside your AO ID you have a different Library version of lvgl I'm talking about so first cross check that which Library version of lvgl we have installed for that I'll go to sketch into include Library into manage libraries here I'll type out as lvgl press enter and here is the lvgl library version 83.6 now I'll go back to the lvgl documentation and here I'll select the version 8 .36 and now it will refresh the page and will provide us all the codes for that particular Library version and now if I go to the widgets and copy the button example code which is provided here so I'll copy both the example codes uh both the functions we'll paste them above the void setup as we did before we'll copy this function and add it inside our void setup and now if I hit the upload button the code will get successfully compiled and it will get uploaded as well so first let's just observe how the code actually looks like in our screen so I'll turn on my smartphone's camera and here as you can see we got two buttons one is labeled as button and other is labeled as toggle okay and I can click both the buttons perfect but we are not able to see any kind of response in the serial monitor let just let me just open it if I click on the toggle button nothing in the serial monitor if I click on the button button no response in the serial monitor because we haven't added any kind of events yet now let me show you how to add events to this button widget using the event handler function and also I'll show you how to customize this button so first let me show you how to change the configurations of the button so here we'll go to the LV example button _ one function and here as you have seen there are two different kind of buttons displayed on our uh display so I just change that to only one single button so I'll remove this many lines which will delete the button okay so now we do have only one single button here you can change it in the label section so here I can write as my button and with this the name of the button displayed on the display will get changed and next if you want to change the position of the button well he you can do in the Align function so right now it is 0 comma -40 as respect to the center point of the display so here I can change the position like 100 and um minus 100 so X is 100 and Y is- 100 just a very like very random uh coordinates I have chosen and you can choose any of the coordinates that you want and that's how you can change the placement of of the button that's how the all the configurations are done and now if I talk about how to do or perform some kind of task when the button is clicked well that is a mentioned here inside the ad event so first of all we need to provide an event handler function or attach a event handler function with our object which is button and inside that event handler function we can provide the uh task that we want to perform so if the button is clicked let's just do a very simple task of printing on serial monitor as button uh click perfect and we need to begin in the C monitor as well and let me just hit the upload button so with this if I click the button it will just print as button clicked and Al also the position of the button is changed and here as I'm written a Serial print you can write any line of code that you want to perform when the button is clicked the code is uploaded and as you can see the name of the button is changed to my button and now we do have only one single button on the screen and it position is also changed and now if I open the serial Monitor and let's just try to press the button and as you can see it says button clicked so every time I press the button it will just say that button clicked and the touch is really smooth because it's a capacitive touch panel here so yeah that's how you can use the button widget that's how you can use the event handler to do all the task and that's how I use four different buttons for controlling four different appliances now let's move on to the next widget which is to control the speed of the fan so for that I have used the roller widget here so you can get the roller widget uh details here inside the roller section here if I go to the example like be following the same process I will teach you the process but how to use the widget so again here I'll open the soc code and here there are three different kind of rollers that they have uh know shown but we want only one single roller so I'll just copy this much line of code because the other two set of code is for the other two rollers so I'll copy that and I'll again follow the same steps that I have followed before I'll first of all delete the button part and I'll paste the roller part and close the function perfect we got our roller function here and we just need to uh copy this line of code and paste it here to Showcase that roller in our display let's just hit the upload button and let see if we get any error or not oh we got the error and it's about the font style so here they are using kind of a font but I uh don't find that kind of font inside this code and also I tried to search for it on online on different different forums but I didn't find the solution of it so solution M just comment it out and hit the upload button it works okay so the code is successfully uploaded and here on our screen we got a roller which I can know slide up and down so I can change the number up to 10 I guess yes and I can scroll up to go to the number one and that's how you can use this kind of roller uh to control the speed of the fan to select any option any kind of thing I personally use it for controlling the speed of the fan from speed one to speed 4 and also off off position as well to turn off the fan now here again the steps are same you can configure everything here you can assign the task here like uh you can configure how many steps you want by changing this number you can configure its position by changing this you can assign the uh add event or we can say the call back function using this ad event function so event handler is assigned and whatever number is selected will be stored inside this character array buffer and you can compare that number to do any kind of task as I did for compare uh controlling the speed of the fan simple process simple steps need to be followed for learning different different widget and that's how you can learn all the different widget try out their sample codes and use it for your application just like I use for my home automation project well it was not easy task it do require a lot of time lot of efforts lot of patience a lot of configurations to build a dashboard like this but eventually I made the complete Dash dashboard and I'll be providing its sample code to you so that you can use it for your reference absolutely free of course and make your own version of the home automation project and that's how we completed the second part of this video that is to build the GUI and now we are left with the third and the most important part which is to link our dashboard or our tablet and our home automation project using Ardo iot Cloud so let me show you that process as well so for that I'll go into my ardino I cloud and log to my account now as you can see I have the ardino Nano board already configured for my home automation project and I do have all the variables like the relay uh the temperature humidity fan and all the things and it is in working condition as you can see the status is currently online I'll go back to the things and let's just add another device another thing which is our Ardo gig1 Wi-Fi board so I'll click on the create button now in my case I already connected the gig R1 Wi-Fi board with my computer and I already installed the U create agent which is running now I'll click on select device and click on on set up a new device it's a board from ardino so I'll select ardino here and now it will automatically recognize the board connected with it okay so G1 found I'll click on the configure button Let's us keep the name as it is and click on the next button and we are done adding the device click on the done button so our device is successfully Associated next step is to provide the network credential so I'll provide the Sid name and password of my Wi-Fi router here perfect click on the save button and now we need to add the variable so click on ADD variable now here we'll be adding the same variable that we added for our home automation project that means four relay variables two variables for Sensor One temperature one humidity and one variable for uh fan speed control so I quickly add them one by one okay with this we successfully added all the cloud variables required for this project and now we need to sync this variables with the variables already created for our home automation project running on the ardino Nano board and to do that ardino ID cloud has a very useful feature and you can do this with a one single click let me show you how to sync uh two different variables from two different device so let's try out with the relay one so I'll click on this uh Cloud variable click on edit variable and here I'll click on sync with other things now here I will select the relay one variable from the ardino Nano device or Ardo Nano thing you can see I'll click here click on synchronize variable and just click on the save button and now what will happen is whatever data is there inside the relay one variable of ardino Nano it will automatically sync with the relay one variable of our ardino Giga board so if I click the button here and if I send the data it will reflect in the ardino Nano as well and that's how you can sync all other variables to you know transfer the data to and fro between the things so let me do the synchronization process for all other variables and we are done we have successfully synced all the variables for relays fan and the sensors and now if I go to the sketch portion that it already created a sample sketch with all the cloud variables declared in the code now now what we need to do is we need to Club this iot cloud-based code with our code that we have created for creating all the graphical user interface we just need to Club them together and I already did that and let me show you that final code so here is that final code and here I already included the things properties. header file that contains my Sid name and password all the cloud variables and everything is declared here and here in the main code I already provided all the functions required for the cloud variables and now how I link the graphical user interface with the cloud section well what I did here is if I take the example of a button then inside the call back function of button let me show you the example for button one so inside the button one event handler that is the event handler for example button one what I did is as soon as the button is toggled I'll print on the serial monitor as button one toggled and also I'm toggling the relay one state and relay one is nothing but the cloud variable so what it will do is it will change the data on the relay One Cloud variable of ardino Giga board which is synced with the ardino Nano variable and ultimately it will turn on the light and that's how I did for all the variabl and with this we successfully made our graphical user interface based dashboard to control the appliances on the other device over internet using aino iot cloud and now let me just try to upload this code and show you its practical working demo so here is the complete dashboard that I made and here on the top left corner I just added a label widget that contains the title of our project and now let's say this in action so here you can see I can easily control all the four lights using the button with a very low latency and along with controlling them I can also control the speed of the fan from 25% to 100% also we can visualize the current temperature and humidity senses data on the meter widget along with their values at the bottom and that is our own made kind of mini tablet to control and monitor your iot devices well do click the like button if you really like the project or at least got to learn something new from it also do share this video with your friends whom you think should try their hands on with this project we'll be providing all the codes required for it in a giup repository whose link you can find in the description of this video and yeah that being said I am just ending this video here and now just wait for my next video and then explore learn share with me te [Music] SMS
