[Music] hey guys MJ here from night walker gear today we're going to look at the new Nightcore mt2a Pro how is T up against other similar lights and why in today's landscape of high powered high capacity 18650 and 217 Z batteries why do we still have the need for AA battery lights so let me give you some context at 50 lumens two AA batteries can power the light for 11 hours a maxed out 217 battery like this can power the light for 50 hours that's 4.5 times longer that means one of this is equal to 18 pieces of AA batteries and this is rechargeable so for the sheer amount of cost and environmental savings it only makes sense to use rechargeable batteries but the biggest problem is you can't walk into any random convenience store anywhere in the world just to buy this type of batteries off the shelf for AA batteries you can even in disaster survival situations you can find AA batteries in people's homes remote controls clocks right kids toys so this got me thinking about know four very specific types of users that will go after the mt2a pro right the first is someone who needs AA battery lights for travel because of availability one client was telling me that he hates absolutely hates waiting at cafes and hotels to charge his gear when he could be out doing actual adventuring so with these there's no wasting time waiting for it to charge just pop in new batteries and go second is someone who wants a slim yet bright light to fit a compact 2 Kit moly webbing pens pocket AAA power lights like the mt06 here or the M10 here from Spas are Slimmer but they are not bright enough the brightest one caps out at 250 lumens here if you look at the next tier of th000 lumen lights like the mh11 the P10 V2 right these use 1 in6 batteries and will become too thick to fit right if you can compare the size these really are bigger so AA size lights gives you a good fit while still packing a punch thickness also affects grip which brings me to the third user someone who wants an effective self-defense tool if you have some experience with long or short blade striking and want to transfer the same mechanics over right without actually carrying a weapon right this is perfect because it sticks out enough to make a difference right see this Gap here it's almost the same as something like this this much longer of course the mt2a pro Feels Like a Knife grip right with just enough coming out the bottom something like the mh11 right it's too short it's not enough for impact SRT 7i yes is sticks out too but it's too big and too slow the new bevel design makes it incredibly grippy it's the same deep cut design as the new mh12 Pro right just on a smaller scale and it works great even you have gloves in wet weather the new grippy tube makes holding uh drawing holstering all easier and you don't have to be so reliant on a lanyard Loop for retention the fourth user is someone who wants a backup to a main light say the mh12 pro so if you ever find yourself stuck without any way to charge your lights via the USB port on all the modern lights you at least have a light designed to use a different power source right you have options the pros will call this packing for redundancy another true story from a client that went on a 10day safari trip one guy brought his fancy new camera with a kit full of lenses to capture the whole experience but on the third day his charger died by the fourth day he's batteries died and for the remaining 6 days he couldn't use his camera at all so packing for redundancy means making sure you have a backup of essential Tools in your kit for what you need which in his case he should have brought two charges so that's similar to us relying on lights as our essential tools your main light Dice and you don't have a USB port to charge it you better make sure you have a separate light that you can still rely on that uses a different power source which you can find or Source or scavenge from so if you have similar needs to any of the four types of users then the mt2a pro is perfect because it sits between two Thin and two thick and yet still packing a 1,000 Lumen punch but you might be wondering how does the mt2a pro get 1,000 lumens from just two doublea batteries while the older mt2a only manage 345 lumens it actually gets his power from a long NL 1416 R battery at 1,600 mamp this is USBC rechargeable here so yes you have to remove the battery to charge it it goes from zero to full in Just 2 hours and will net you around 3 hours run time on 300 lumens and a decent 1 hour 40 minutes on 1,000 lumens and at low mode 50 Lums this does an incredibly long 20 hours this comes included with the light with a USBC charging cable as well so most guys will keep this inside until for some reason they need to swap out to AA batteries then the max output is 500 lumens for 2 hours and 60 Lum for 11 hours which is still a big upgrade over the older mt2a so it's very possible to not use the long battery and just run it off two a a batteries if you like it's up to you before we get into controls and how it works if you want to win this latest mt2a Pro do subscribe to the channel below and comment on if you only had one advice for someone buying a flashlight for the first time what would it be right once we hit 500 likes I'll pick the winner and announce them in the description box below now how it works is also slightly different the previous version you couldn't change brightness unless you slightly untwist the hip right then on and off the tail cap that's how you change brightness and get to stroke so whenever you tighten a tail cap it goes to Turbo the mt2a pro gets rid of all that double-handed twisting in favor of a single button press right to cycle through the modes right this here I'm doing half press you can also full press the light and it also changes mod right this does give you one-handed control but you lose momentary signaling right so when I try to Signal three long three short it actually changes brightness instead so if you need that signal function right then this is not the light for you the LED has been upgraded to the new in-house uhi LED right that is what gives it the brighter lumens so here are some real life beam shots of the mt2a pro these UI LEDs have a very distinct round Hotpot in the middle quite defined and might be good or bad depending on what industry you're in swamp Mangrove kind of area right good spot to search to point out items things far away right it's 1,000 Lum the beam Pro is about 255 M so this the kind of a performance you get you can bring it down this is uh 60 lumus 300 Lumas still very decent one more time the turbo the bridge problem so you have a Street Lamp there so you have some context of how the light actually looks like very nice so so do note the anti- roll design from the older mt2a has been removed this stops it from Rolling away on a slanted table right the pro version is completely round so it it does roll all the way if it's on a slant table so I assume they're betting on the new pocket clip here only one place to install you can't install it this way only here but two ways to clip in on the front here or on the back here so it's light enough to be clipped on a cap like this or backpack strap like this for handsfree use lanard is included you can run it to your wrist or around your fist this way for better retention no holster because remember the thickness is designed to be as thin as possible to fit in your pocket and such so it's not designed to be used on a belt the older mt2a holers do fit right here I'm using the mh12 pro holster as well so everything does fit if you are set on protecting it this way attachments wise these do not fit any of the 23 or 25 mm filters and Cones so do note if you need those you're out of luck for now maybe later on nikco release the right size and cones for this mp28 Pro right so that's basically it a simple straightforward light that's designed around AA battery dimensions for worldwide travel and efficient self-defense so should you get the mt2a pro right if you already using a two double A battery light or the older mt2a then this will be a great upgrade because it does give you almost double the brightness right which with a much improved grip and much lighter weight as well this only 40 G 40 G but if you're looking for a flashlight around the th000 Lumen Mark with similar price range and don't care for AA batteries then I recommend looking at other models like the mh11 P10 V2 all of these are thousand Lum lights as well from nightore they will outshine and Outlast the mt2a pro because of their larger battery these are using 18650 batteries if you look even further for the same price but 2000 Lumen and double the runtime is the Speas E21 here an incredible performance light but the problem is you can't remove the battery it's a buil-in charging PT so that's a huge thing to consider if you're looking for backup light or need to swap and go overseas but in terms of price it's very very close to the mt2a pro now you know exactly where the mt2a pro sits in night Calla lineup it users are quite targeted for myself I always take this when going to countries where I know I won't be able to recharge for a few days at a time plus the self-defense capability is always a plus point right these are all in stock now at
