Use headphones for the best experience. Just 58 km north of India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, there is one small and super quiet island. Its name is Cocoa Island. Officially, Myanmar owns it. But recently, new satellite photos came out.

They showed something shocking. The old runway was only 1,400 m long and made of dirt. Now, it is fully rebuilt. It is now 2,300 m long and made of strong concrete. This new runway is big enough for fighter jets like J10, big transport planes like Y8, and even early warning planes like KJ500 to land and fly easily.

On top of that, a brand new powerful radar has appeared on the North Hill of the island. This is an over the horizon radar. It can see 500 to 600 kilometers deep into Indian airspace and into the shipping lanes of the Indian Ocean. Now, stop and think for a second. The population of Koko Island is less than 1,000 people.

There are no commercial flights. There is no tourism. So, why does this tiny forgotten island suddenly need a runway big enough for fighter jets and a super strong military radar? The answer is very simple. China.

Many intelligence agencies, Indian-American and Japanese, say the same thing. >> 2,300 meter runway on the great Koko Island. >> Myanmar's army is upgrading Koko Island with Chinese money, Chinese engineers, and Chinese machines. China wants to watch every move of the Indian Navy and Indian Air Force 24 hours a day from just 58 km away. So friends, this is the real story of the biggest silent war going on right now, the India versus China fight in the Indian Ocean. In this video, we are going to talk about how China is trying to control the most important geopolitical place in the world, the Indian Ocean, and how India is fighting back all alone, taking on China, competing hard, and showing the world who is the real boss in the Indian Ocean. This is going to be the most eyeopening video you'll watch today.

Stay till the end. Before starting the video, a humble request for you guys. It's very hurtful to see that 93% of our audience didn't subscribe to our channel. If you're enjoying our content, please like, share, and subscribe to our channel. So, YouTube recommends this video to more people.

Why is the Indian Ocean so important that two countries with nuclear bombs are quietly fighting for every island and every port? When you hear the simple numbers, your mind will explode. 80% of China's crude oil comes through the Indian Ocean. 90% of Japan's oil comes the same way. 95% of South Korea's oil, too. 60% of all China's trade passes here. 50% of the world's containers sail through this ocean. 40% of the world's oil trade moves here. All this huge traffic has to pass through just three super narrow gates. These are called choke points. Straight of Malaa only 2.8 km wide at the narrowest place.

Straight of Hormuz only 33 km wide. Babel Mandeb only 29 km wide. If even one of these gates gets blocked for just 10 days, China's factories stop working. Petrol pumps go empty. Prices go crazy all over the world.

Now listen to China's biggest nightmare. India sits exactly at the western gate of the Malaca Strait thanks to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. India has 572 islands in a long chain that stretches 800 km from north to south. From the topmost island called Landfall Island to the bottom point called Indira Point, India can watch, block or open the Malaa Strait anytime it wants. In case of war, the Indian Navy and Air Force can shut the Mala Strait in just a few hours.

China's oil lifeline gets cut. In a few weeks, China's whole economy falls down. That is exactly why China is scared to death of India in the Indian Ocean. So, China made a master plan called string of pearls. A circle of ports and bases all around India.

Let's see every single pearl one by one. Pearl 1 is Chitagong port in Bangladesh. China invested more than $2 billion under the belt and road initiative. It is also the main naval base of the Bangladesh Navy. A US intelligence report from 2022 says China has secret electronic listening posts here that track Indian Navy movements in the Bay of Bengal.

Pearl 2 is Kiuku port in Myanmar. It's a 7.3 billion Chinese project. It has a deep sea port, a special economic zone, and an oil and gas pipeline that goes straight to Yunan province in China. Satellite images from 2021 to 2023 show Chinese Navy submarines and warships visiting regularly. And Koko Island, which we already talked about, has a runway and radar that was completed in 2023.

Pearl 3 is Hammond port in Sri Lanka. China gave Sri Lanka a $1.4 billion loan. Sri Lanka couldn't pay, so in 2017, Sri Lanka gave the port to China on a 99-year lease. It's the same trick the British used in Hong Kong. Chinese research and spy ships with huge antennas visit every few months.

In August 2022, the UN Wang 5 spy ship stayed for 7 days even though India protested. Pearl 4 is Guad in Pakistan. It's a 62 billion project as part of the China Pakistan economic corridor CPAC. It's located just 400 km from the straight of Hormuz. Chinese Navy warships and submarines are now openly docking here.

In March 2025, two Type039 submarines were seen here. Pearl 5 is Djibouti base, which is China's first overseas military base. It opened in 2017 and has 3,500 Chinese marines, tanks, helicopters, and warships. It's right next to US and French bases and controls the Babel Mandeb Strait. Pearl six is Bagamoyo Port in Tanzania which is a10 billion project.

Pearl 7 is Lamu Port in Kenya which is funded by China. Pearl 8 is Re Naval Base in Cambodia where Chinese money is being used. Satellite images show two 11,000 ton peers that are big enough for aircraft carriers. This entire circle is China's plan to watch India surround India and in case of war choke India from all sides. India is pushing back against China's string of pearls with its own plan called the necklace of diamonds.

Here's how India is countering China's moves. India's first move is the Andaman and Nicobar Islands which is like an unsinkable aircraft carrier. Between 2020 and 2025, India spent over 15,000 cr rupees here. There's a new 30,000 meter runway at Campbell Bay that can handle P8 planes and fighters. The naval base INS BAS has been upgraded and four new landing ships and more submarines are being stationed here.

In 2024, India set up a powerful coastal radar chain that can see all the way to Cocoa Island. India has also made a deal with Indonesia to use Sabang port which is at the western entrance of the Malaa Strait. Indian warships and P8I planes can now refuel and repair here in the Sey Shells. India is building a naval base and a 30,000 meter airirstrip on Assumption Island. Work started again in 2024 after a small delay.

India has a logistics agreement with Oman which gives the Indian Navy a dedicated birth at DQM port. In 2024, India stored Brahmos missiles and spare parts here. India has invested $500 million in Chabahar port in Iran which is now operational. This port gives India a direct route to Afghanistan and Central Asia bypassing Pakistan. India has also made deals with Singapore where Indian aircraft carrier groups and submarines can use Changi Naval Base.

The UK and US let India use Diego Garcia, a major military base in the Indian Ocean for intelligence sharing. France is a key partner for India in the Indian Ocean with permanent bases on Reunion Island and other territories. India and France do joint patrols and exercises together. Australia is also working with India and through the Quad and AUS, it's getting nuclear submarines to help secure the Indian Ocean. India has set up an information fusion center to track ship movements in the Indian Ocean and many countries share data here.

India is also selling weapons like Brahmos missiles to countries like the Philippines and Armenia and is talking to others in the region to counter China's control of the Malaca Strait. India is promoting alternative routes like the Lombok and Sunda Straits where India has more influence. India is also giving patrol boats, radar stations and training to countries like the Maldives, Maitius and Seyell so they don't fall into China's debt trap. In 2024, India hosted the Milan naval exercise with 51 countries which was the biggest ever and China wasn't invited. So friends, the score right now, China has money.

India has geography plus friends plus smart strategy. China is trying to buy the Indian Ocean. India is protecting it without putting anyone in debt. Now tell me in the comments, who do you think will win this silent war in the next 10 years? Can India completely break China's string of pearls or will China buy more small countries?
