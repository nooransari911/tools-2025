an aws service creates output file in s3. the path of file is like: bucket-name/some-random-string/filename. everytime the service is run, the service uses a new random string and uses that as prefix to create a new file.

write a series of python function to get the most recently created file. follow single respnsbility principle as much as possible, though its not a strict requirement. any s3 api operation must have a similar function signature like this function for s3 put operation (though its not a strict requirement):

def s3_put_operation (S3Client, role_arn, data):
    """Execute S3 Put operation on data; Returns (Success?True:False, Head_Object)"""
    
    try:
        # assume_role (role_arn, "ClaudeS3Session")
        # s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
        s3_put_op = S3Client.put_object(
            Bucket=S3_SRC,
            Key=INPUT_JSONL_FILE_NAME,
            Body=data
        )
        s3_head_op = S3Client.head_object(
            Bucket=S3_SRC,
            Key=INPUT_JSONL_FILE_NAME
        )

        
        return (True, s3_head_op)

    except Exception as e:
        error_msg = f"PutObject verification failed: {e}"
        print(error_msg)
        return (False, error_msg)



Names/identifiers must be like HelloWorld
