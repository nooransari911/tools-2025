write a theory note. topics are explicitly identified. requirements:
1. core focus should be core prinicples (what its based on), core of what it provides and their importance. Ex., cryptogrpahic digital signatures. focus on: its based (technically can be based) on asymm cryptography; entity signs (encrypts) with its private key, someone else can verify it by decrypting it with public key. it provides non-repudiation, integrity, authentication. its important because it provides proof of origin/authenticity, which is the foundation for all of cybersecurity. all access control, encryption, etc. fails without strong authentication
2. use simple, natural, human-like language
3. maintain proper straightforward flow. have good flow and clarity
4. have balanced depth and length
5. structure it in markdown properly. headings start from level h1. create sections and sub sections with headings with appropriate levels as needed

topics: digital signature with asymm crypto. encryption (AES, DES)
