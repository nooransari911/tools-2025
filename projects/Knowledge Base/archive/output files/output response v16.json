While the revenues today are still primarily from disc storage devices, the storage hosts have expanded from PCs to other devices such as video recorders, televisions, and games. Seagate was one of the pioneers in implementing the Critical Chain methodology. Speed to market, with new technology, is very important in Seagate's strategy. Generally, the first supplier to deliver an innovative new product to a market enjoys the combination of high margins and high volume, until the competitors catch up.
