I'll help you refine this prompt for working with text files to create matched content. Let me analyze what's here first before offering specific improvements.

The prompt asks users to upload two files: a template and a supplementary information file. It then provides instructions for analyzing different template formats (PDF, plain text from PDF, or text file) and creating new content that matches the template's structure while incorporating domain-specific information from the supplementary file.

Here are my thoughts on improving this prompt:

# Refined File-Based Content Creation Prompt

## File Submission Instructions

Please upload two files:
1. **Template file** (PDF, plain text converted from PDF, or text file) - This shows the structure and style to match
2. **Supplementary file** - Contains domain-specific/technical information for the new content

Label at least the supplementary file explicitly when uploading.

## Template Analysis Process

### For PDF Templates
I'll analyze the document's structure, formatting, writing style, section organization, and visual hierarchy.

### For Plain Text Converted from PDF
I'll reconstruct the original document structure by:
- Identifying heading levels and section organization
- Interpreting paragraph breaks and text flow despite conversion artifacts
- Recognizing where tables, lists, and visual elements were present
- Inferring formatting conventions (bold, italic, etc.) from context clues
- Working around irregular spacing and alignment issues

### For Text Files
- I'll process any `<note></note>` tags you include for additional context
- If content comes from multiple text files, I'll treat each labeled section accordingly
- I'll analyze overall structure, tone, and organizational patterns

## Content Creation Process

After template analysis, I'll:

1. Extract key domain knowledge from your supplementary file
2. Create new content that:
   - Follows the template's exact structure and organization
   - Matches the technical depth and terminology density
   - Maintains similar section proportions and overall length
   - Uses natural, human-like language (avoiding AI-sounding patterns)
   - Incorporates appropriate domain-specific terminology

3. Format the new document with:
   - Proper Markdown formatting
   - Appropriate heading hierarchy (starting from H1)
   - Cohesive paragraphs with clear topic sentences
   - Bullet points only where stylistically appropriate

4. If I encounter information gaps, I'll ask specific clarifying questions

5. I'll note any structural elements I had to infer from limited formatting cues

Would you like me to make any specific adjustments to this refined prompt?
