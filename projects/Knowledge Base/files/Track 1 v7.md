## Slide 3: What is a vector?

This slide defines a vector and contrasts it with a scalar.

**Definition:** A vector is a quantity that possesses both **magnitude** and **direction**.

**Examples (Vectors):**

*   **"The coffee shop is five miles *north* of here."**  Magnitude: five miles. Direction: north.
*   **"Light and heat radiate *outward* from the sun at a rate of 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s."** Magnitude: 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s. Direction: outward.
*   **"The cars raced around the track *counterclockwise* , reaching speeds of over 300 mph."** Magnitude: over 300 mph.  Direction: counterclockwise.

**Definition:** A **scalar** is a quantity that has only **magnitude** (no direction).

**Examples (Scalars):**

*   **"To get to the coffee shop, you have to drive five miles."** Magnitude: five miles. No direction is specified.
*   **"Light in a vacuum travels at a rate of 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s."** Magnitude: 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s. No direction is specified.
*   **"The racing cars reached speeds of over 300 mph."** Magnitude: over 300 mph. No direction is specified.

**Key takeaway:** The core distinction between vectors and scalars lies in the presence or absence of directional information.  A scalar describes "how much," while a vector describes "how much" *and* "which way."

## Slide 4: Vector Nomenclature

This slide establishes the notation conventions used for representing vectors, their magnitudes, and unit vectors.

**General Vector Representation:**

A general vector is represented with an overbar:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:larger">A&#772;</span>

**Magnitude of a Vector:**

The magnitude of vector A&#772; can be written in two equivalent ways:

1.  Using absolute value bars:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:larger">|A&#772;|</span>
2.  Using the vector symbol without the overbar:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:larger">A</span>

**Important Note:** The magnitude of a vector (represented as *A* or |A&#772;|) is a *scalar* quantity. It represents only the "length" or "strength" of the vector, without any directional information.

**Unit Vector Representation:**

A unit vector is denoted by a "hat" (circumflex) symbol above the variable, along with a subscript indicating its direction.  The unit vector in the direction of A&#772; is written as:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:larger">â<sub>A</sub></span>

**Key takeaway:** Consistent notation is crucial for clarity in vector algebra.  Overbars denote vectors, absolute value bars (or the letter alone) denote magnitudes, and hats denote unit vectors.

## Slide 5: Unit Vectors

This slide defines unit vectors and explains their significance.

**Definition:** A unit vector is any vector with a **magnitude equal to one.**  Its sole purpose is to specify direction.

**Unit Vector in the Direction of A&#772;:**

The unit vector in the direction of a vector A&#772; is calculated by dividing the vector by its magnitude:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:larger">â<sub>A</sub> = A&#772; / A</span>

or, equivalently:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:larger">â<sub>A</sub> = A&#772; / |A&#772;|</span>

**Explanation:** Dividing a vector by its magnitude scales it down (or up) to a length of 1 while preserving its original direction.

**Importance of Unit Vectors:**

*   **Specifying Direction:** Unit vectors provide a concise way to represent direction without concern for magnitude.
*   **Defining Coordinate Systems:** Unit vectors form the basis of coordinate systems.

**Coordinate Systems and Basis Vectors:**

*   Spatial vectors (vectors in 3D space) are typically described as the sum of three linearly independent (mutually orthogonal, meaning at right angles to each other) component vectors.
*   A **coordinate system** is a framework for describing locations in space.
*   The three unit vectors used to define a coordinate system are called **basis vectors**.

**Key takeaway:** Unit vectors are fundamental building blocks in vector analysis. They provide a normalized way to represent direction, and they are crucial for defining coordinate systems.

## Slide 6: The Cartesian Coordinate System

This slide introduces the Cartesian coordinate system, its basis vectors, and coordinate variables.

**Basis Vectors:**

The Cartesian coordinate system uses three mutually orthogonal unit vectors:

*   **â<sub>x</sub>:**  Points along the positive x-axis.
*   **â<sub>y</sub>:**  Points along the positive y-axis.
*   **â<sub>z</sub>:**  Points along the positive z-axis.

**Coordinate Variables:**

The position of a point in the Cartesian coordinate system is defined by three scalar values:

*   **x:**  The coordinate along the x-axis.
*   **y:**  The coordinate along the y-axis.
*   **z:**  The coordinate along the z-axis.

**Diagram:**

The slide shows a standard 3D Cartesian coordinate system with the x, y, and z axes, and a point P located in space. The dashed lines illustrate the projection of point P onto each of the coordinate planes.

**Key takeaway:** The Cartesian coordinate system is a fundamental and widely used system for representing points and vectors in 3D space.  It relies on three orthogonal axes and corresponding unit vectors.

## Slide 7: The Cartesian Coordinate System (Continued)

This slide describes how to represent a general vector within the Cartesian coordinate system and defines the ranges of the coordinate variables.

**Vector Representation:**

Any vector A&#772; in the Cartesian coordinate system can be expressed as a linear combination (a scaled sum) of the basis vectors:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:larger">A&#772; = A<sub>x</sub>â<sub>x</sub> + A<sub>y</sub>â<sub>y</sub> + A<sub>z</sub>â<sub>z</sub></span>

Where:

*   **A<sub>x</sub>:** The scalar component of A&#772; along the x-axis.
*   **A<sub>y</sub>:** The scalar component of A&#772; along the y-axis.
*   **A<sub>z</sub>:** The scalar component of A&#772; along the z-axis.

These scalar components (A<sub>x</sub>, A<sub>y</sub>, A<sub>z</sub>) represent the *magnitudes* of the vector's projections onto the respective axes.

**Ranges of Coordinate Variables:**

The Cartesian coordinate variables can take on any real value, extending to infinity in both positive and negative directions:

*   -∞ ≤ x ≤ +∞
*   -∞ ≤ y ≤ +∞
*   -∞ ≤ z ≤ +∞

**Key takeaway:** Any vector in Cartesian coordinates can be decomposed into its x, y, and z components, each scaled by the corresponding unit vector. The coordinate variables themselves can range from negative to positive infinity.

## Slide 8: Vector Addition: Numerical

This slide explains how to perform vector addition numerically in the Cartesian coordinate system.

**Vector Addition Principle:**

Vector addition is performed by adding the corresponding components of the vectors.

**Numerical Vector Addition:**

Given two vectors:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:larger">A&#772; = A<sub>x</sub>â<sub>x</sub> + A<sub>y</sub>â<sub>y</sub> + A<sub>z</sub>â<sub>z</sub></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:larger">B&#772; = B<sub>x</sub>â<sub>x</sub> + B<sub>y</sub>â<sub>y</sub> + B<sub>z</sub>â<sub>z</sub></span>

Their sum, A&#772; + B&#772;, is calculated as:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size:larger">A&#772; + B&#772; = (A<sub>x</sub> + B<sub>x</sub>)â<sub>x</sub> + (A<sub>y</sub> + B<sub>y</sub>)â<sub>y</sub> + (A<sub>z</sub> + B<sub>z</sub>)â<sub>z</sub></span>

**Explanation:**

1.  **Add x-components:**  A<sub>x</sub> + B<sub>x</sub>
2.  **Add y-components:**  A<sub>y</sub> + B<sub>y</sub>
3.  **Add z-components:**  A<sub>z</sub> + B<sub>z</sub>
4.  The resulting vector is formed by combining these summed components with their respective unit vectors.

**Important Restriction:** This simple component-wise addition *only* works directly for vectors expressed in **Cartesian coordinates**.  For other coordinate systems (e.g., cylindrical, spherical), the process is more complex because the basis vectors themselves can change direction depending on position.

**Key takeaway:** Vector addition in Cartesian coordinates is straightforward: add the corresponding components.  This simplicity is a major advantage of the Cartesian system.

# Magnetostatic Material Interaction

This document provides comprehensive notes on the Ansys course "Magnetostatic Material Interaction," developed by Kathryn L. Smith, PhD.  It covers the fundamental laws of magnetostatics, focusing on how magnetic fields interact with materials.

## Sources

The material is drawn from these key electromagnetics textbooks:

*   **Elements of Electromagnetics**, by Matthew N.O. Sadiku, 5th ed. (2010)
*   **Engineering Electromagnetics**, by Nathan Ida, 3rd ed. (2015)
*   **Microwave Engineering**, by David Pozar, 4th ed. (2012)

## Agenda

The course covers the following topics, all in the context of how materials affect magnetostatic fields:

1.  **The Constitutive Relation:** Describing the relationship between magnetic field intensity (H) and magnetic flux density (B) in materials.
2.  **Boundary Conditions for the Magnetic Field:** How the magnetic field behaves at the interface between different materials.
3.  **Inductance:**  The property of a circuit element to store energy in a magnetic field, including self-inductance and mutual inductance.
4.  **Energy, Forces, and Torques:**  Calculating the energy stored in a magnetic field and the forces and torques experienced by objects within the field.
5.  **Faraday's Law and Lenz's Law:**  The principles governing the generation of voltage (electromotive force) due to a changing magnetic flux.
6.  **Motional and Transformer EMF:** Distinguishing between the two types of induced electromotive force (EMF): one due to the motion of a conductor in a magnetic field and the other due to a time-varying magnetic field.

## The Constitutive Relation

**Free Space vs. Materials:**

In free space, the magnetic field intensity (<span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span>) and the magnetic flux density (<span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span>) are related by the permeability of free space (µ<sub>0</sub>):

<span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span> = µ<sub>0</sub><span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span>

However, engineering applications rarely involve only free space.  We use materials (dielectrics, conductors) to manipulate magnetic fields. Therefore, understanding the interaction between magnetic fields and materials is crucial.

**Atomic Magnetization:**

*   Within a material, the motion of electrons within atoms creates *atomic magnetic dipoles*, represented by the magnetization vector, <span style="text-decoration: overline">m</span>.  Think of each atom as a tiny current loop, generating a small magnetic field.

*   **Unbiased Material:** In a neutral, unbiased material, these atomic magnetic moments are randomly oriented.  The vector sum of all these moments is zero, resulting in *no net magnetic field*.

*   **Biased Material:**  When an external magnetic field (<span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span><sub>a</sub>, "applied field") is applied, the atomic magnetic moments tend to align with the applied field.  This alignment creates a *response field* (<span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span><sub>r</sub>).

**Relative Permeability (µ<sub>r</sub>):**

The material's response to the applied field is quantified by the *relative permeability* (µ<sub>r</sub>). This is a bulk material parameter.  The constitutive relation for <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span> in a material is:

<span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span> = µ<sub>0</sub>µ<sub>r</sub> * <span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span> = µ * <span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span>

where:

*   µ = µ<sub>0</sub>µ<sub>r</sub> is the *permeability* of the material.
*   \* represents convolution.

**Homogeneity and Frequency Dependence:**

*   The constitutive relation assumes the material is *homogeneous* at the scale of interest (or appears so at the wavelength scale).  This means the material properties are uniform throughout.  Imagine a material where the atomic structure is much smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic field.

*   The relative permeability (µ<sub>r</sub>) can be *frequency-dependent*.  The \* (convolution) operator in the equation above accounts for this.  Convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain.  This implies that the material's response can vary depending on the frequency of the applied field.

*   **Simplification for this Course:** For simplicity, this course assumes that µ<sub>r</sub> is *constant* with respect to frequency. This allows us to replace the convolution with simple multiplication:

    <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span> = µ<span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span>

## Boundary Conditions for the Magnetic Field

**Surface Current:**

When a magnetic field crosses a boundary between two materials with different permeabilities (µ<sub>r1</sub> ≠ µ<sub>r2</sub>), a *surface current* (<span style="text-decoration: overline">J</span><sub>s</sub>) may be generated on the boundary. This surface current is a sheet of current flowing on the interface.

**Normal and Tangential Components:**

To analyze the field behavior at the boundary, we decompose the magnetic field intensity (<span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span>) into *normal* and *tangential* components relative to the boundary:

*   <span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span><sub>1n</sub>: Normal component of <span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span> in region 1.
*   <span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span><sub>1t</sub>: Tangential component of <span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span> in region 1.
*   <span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span><sub>2n</sub>: Normal component of <span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span> in region 2.
*   <span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span><sub>2t</sub>: Tangential component of <span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span> in region 2.

**Derivation of Tangential Boundary Condition (Ampere's Law):**

1.  **Ampere's Law:** Consider a small rectangular loop (abcd) crossing the boundary, with sides parallel and perpendicular to the interface.  Apply Ampere's Circuital Law:

    ∮<sub>abcd</sub> <span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span> ⋅ d<span style="text-decoration: overline">l</span> = I<sub>enclosed</sub>

    Where:

    *   ∮<sub>abcd</sub> represents the closed line integral around the loop abcd.
    *   d<span style="text-decoration: overline">l</span> is an infinitesimal length element along the loop.
    *   I<sub>enclosed</sub> is the total current enclosed by the loop.

2.  **Shrinking the Loop:**  Let the height of the loop (the sides perpendicular to the boundary) approach zero.  As the height shrinks, the contribution of the normal components (H<sub>1n</sub> and H<sub>2n</sub>) to the line integral becomes negligible.

3.  **Surface Current:** The current enclosed by the loop is due to the surface current density (<span style="text-decoration: overline">J</span><sub>s</sub>).  If the width of the loop along the boundary is Δw, then I<sub>enclosed</sub> = J<sub>s</sub>Δw.

4.  **Result:**  The line integral reduces to:

    H<sub>1t</sub>Δw - H<sub>2t</sub>Δw = J<sub>s</sub>Δw

    Dividing by Δw, we get the tangential boundary condition:

    H<sub>1t</sub> - H<sub>2t</sub> = J<sub>s</sub>

    This states that the *discontinuity* in the tangential component of the magnetic field intensity is equal to the surface current density.

**Derivation of Normal Boundary Condition (Solenoidal Law):**

1.  **Solenoidal Law (Gauss's Law for Magnetism):** Consider a small cylindrical Gaussian surface (pillbox) that straddles the boundary.  Apply the Solenoidal Law (which states that the net magnetic flux through a closed surface is zero):

    ∮<sub>S</sub> <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span> ⋅ d<span style="text-decoration: overline">s</span> = 0

    Where:

    *   ∮<sub>S</sub> represents the closed surface integral over the pillbox.
    *    d<span style="text-decoration: overline">s</span> is an infinitesimal area element on the surface.

2.  **Shrinking the Height:** Let the height of the cylinder approach zero.  The contribution of the tangential components of <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span> (and therefore <span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span>) to the surface integral becomes negligible.

3.  **Result:** The surface integral reduces to:

     B<sub>1n</sub>ΔS - B<sub>2n</sub>ΔS = 0

     Where ΔS is the area of the top and bottom faces of the cylinder.  Dividing by ΔS, we get:

     B<sub>1n</sub> = B<sub>2n</sub>

     This shows the *normal component of the magnetic flux density is continuous* across the boundary.

4. **Using the constitutive relation:** We can rewrite the above in terms of <span style="text-decoration:overline">H</span>.
    B<sub>1n</sub> = μ<sub>1</sub>H<sub>1n</sub>
    B<sub>2n</sub> = μ<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>

    μ<sub>1</sub>H<sub>1n</sub> = μ<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>

**Summary of Boundary Conditions:**

*   **Tangential:** H<sub>1t</sub> - H<sub>2t</sub> = J<sub>s</sub>
*   **Normal:**  μ<sub>1</sub>H<sub>1n</sub> = μ<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>  or  B<sub>1n</sub> = B<sub>2n</sub>

These two equations completely describe how the magnetic field behaves at the interface between two different magnetic materials.

## Inductance

**Self-Inductance (L<sub>11</sub>):**

1.  **Current Loop:**  Consider a loop of wire (C<sub>1</sub>) carrying a current (I<sub>1</sub>).  This current produces a magnetic flux density (<span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span><sub>1</sub>) around the loop.

2.  **Magnetic Flux:** Some of this magnetic flux links with the loop itself. The total magnetic flux linking the loop due to its own current is denoted as Φ<sub>11</sub>.

3.  **Calculation of Flux:** Φ<sub>11</sub> is calculated by integrating the magnetic flux density (<span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span><sub>1</sub>) over a surface (S<sub>1</sub>) bounded by the loop C<sub>1</sub>:

    Φ<sub>11</sub> = ∫<sub>S1</sub> <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span><sub>1</sub> ⋅ d<span style="text-decoration: overline">s</span><sub>1</sub>

4.  **Biot-Savart Law:**  The Biot-Savart Law tells us that the magnetic flux density (<span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span><sub>1</sub>) is directly proportional to the current (I<sub>1</sub>) that produces it.  Therefore: <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span><sub>1</sub> = (some constant) * I<sub>1</sub>.

5.  **Linear Relationship:** Since <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span><sub>1</sub> is proportional to I<sub>1</sub>, and Φ<sub>11</sub> is the integral of <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span><sub>1</sub>, then Φ<sub>11</sub> is also directly proportional to I<sub>1</sub>.

6.  **Definition of Self-Inductance:**  The constant of proportionality between Φ<sub>11</sub> and I<sub>1</sub> is called the *self-inductance* (L<sub>11</sub>):

    L<sub>11</sub> = Φ<sub>11</sub> / I<sub>1</sub>

**Mutual Inductance (L<sub>12</sub>):**

1.  **Second Loop:** Introduce a second loop (C<sub>2</sub>) near the first loop (C<sub>1</sub>).

2.  **Flux Linkage:** Some of the magnetic flux (<span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span><sub>1</sub>) produced by the current I<sub>1</sub> in loop C<sub>1</sub> will also link with loop C<sub>2</sub>.  This flux linking loop C<sub>2</sub> due to I<sub>1</sub> is denoted as Φ<sub>12</sub>.

3.  **Calculation:**  Φ<sub>12</sub> is calculated by integrating <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span><sub>1</sub> over a surface (S<sub>2</sub>) bounded by loop C<sub>2</sub>:

    Φ<sub>12</sub> = ∫<sub>S2</sub> <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span><sub>1</sub> ⋅ d<span style="text-decoration: overline">s</span><sub>2</sub>

4.  **Proportionality:**  Again, since <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span><sub>1</sub> is proportional to I<sub>1</sub>, Φ<sub>12</sub> is also proportional to I<sub>1</sub>.

5.  **Definition of Mutual Inductance:** The constant of proportionality between Φ<sub>12</sub> and I<sub>1</sub> is the *mutual inductance* (L<sub>12</sub>):

    L<sub>12</sub> = Φ<sub>12</sub> / I<sub>1</sub>

**Generalization to Multiple Turns:**

If loop C<sub>1</sub> has N<sub>1</sub> turns and loop C<sub>2</sub> has N<sub>2</sub> turns, the inductances are:

*   L<sub>11</sub> = (N<sub>1</sub>Φ<sub>11</sub>) / I<sub>1</sub>
*   L<sub>12</sub> = (N<sub>2</sub>Φ<sub>12</sub>) / I<sub>1</sub>

**Reciprocity of Mutual Inductance:**

The mutual inductance is reciprocal, meaning L<sub>12</sub> = L<sub>21</sub>. The flux linking loop 2 due to a current in loop 1 is the same as the flux linking loop 1 due to the same current in loop 2.

L<sub>12</sub> = L<sub>21</sub> = (N<sub>2</sub>Φ<sub>12</sub>) / I<sub>1</sub> = (N<sub>1</sub>Φ<sub>21</sub>) / I<sub>2</sub>

**Self Inductance of Loop 2:**
Similarly, the Self Inductance of Loop 2 can be defined as:
L<sub>22</sub> = (N<sub>2</sub>Φ<sub>22</sub>)/I<sub>2</sub>

## Energy, Forces, and Torques

**Energy Stored in an Inductor:**

1.  **RL Circuit:** Consider a simple RL circuit with a voltage source (V), a resistor (R), and an inductor (L).

2.  **Inductor Voltage:** The voltage across the inductor (V<sub>L</sub>) is related to the rate of change of current:

    V<sub>L</sub> = L (dI/dt)

3.  **Instantaneous Power:** The instantaneous power (P<sub>L</sub>) delivered to the inductor is:

    P<sub>L</sub> = V<sub>L</sub>I = LI (dI/dt)

4.  **Energy:**  Energy (W<sub>m</sub>) is the integral of power over time:

    W<sub>m</sub> = ∫ P<sub>L</sub> dt = ∫ LI (dI/dt) dt = ∫ LI dI = (1/2)LI<sup>2</sup>

    Therefore, the energy stored in an inductor is:

    W<sub>m</sub> = (1/2)LI<sup>2</sup>

**Energy Stored in Multiple Inductive Elements:**

For a system with *n* inductive elements, the total stored energy (W<sub>m</sub>) considers both self and mutual inductances:

W<sub>m</sub> = (1/2) Σ<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup> Σ<sub>j=1</sub><sup>n</sup> L<sub>ji</sub>I<sub>i</sub>I<sub>j</sub>

This double summation accounts for the energy stored due to each inductor's self-inductance and the mutual coupling between all pairs of inductors.

**Energy Density in Terms of Fields:**

The stored energy can also be expressed in terms of the magnetic field intensity (<span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span>) and magnetic flux density (<span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span>):

W<sub>m</sub> = (1/2) ∫<sub>v</sub> <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span> ⋅ <span style="text-decoration: overline">H</span> dv

Where:

*   v is the volume over which the magnetic field exists.

**Forces and Torques:**

1.  **Lorentz Force Law:** A moving electric charge (q) with velocity (<span style="text-decoration: overline">v</span>) in a magnetic field (<span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span>) experiences a force (<span style="text-decoration: overline">F</span><sub>m</sub>):

    <span style="text-decoration: overline">F</span><sub>total</sub> = <span style="text-decoration: overline">F</span><sub>e</sub> + <span style="text-decoration: overline">F</span><sub>m</sub> = q<span style="text-decoration: overline">E</span> + q<span style="text-decoration: overline">v</span> × <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span>

    If the electric field <span style="text-decoration: overline">E</span> is zero:

    <span style="text-decoration: overline">F</span><sub>m</sub> = q<span style="text-decoration: overline">v</span> × <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span>

2.  **Force in Terms of Current:**  Since current is the flow of charge, the magnetic force can be expressed in terms of current (I):

    <span style="text-decoration: overline">F</span><sub>m</sub> = <span style="text-decoration: overline">I</span> × <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span> (This is a vector cross product)

3.  **Torque on a Current Loop:** Consider a rectangular current loop in a uniform magnetic field.  The forces on opposite sides of the loop create a *torque* that tends to rotate the loop.

4.  **Calculating Torque:**
    *   **Side a-b:** Force out of the page (+y direction)
    *   **Side b-c:** Zero force
    *   **Side c-d:** Force into the page (-y direction)
    * Side d-a: Zero Force

    The magnitude of the torque (T) is:

    T = 2Fd/2 = Fd

    Where F is the magnitude of force on each side, and *d* is length of the sides b-c and d-a.

5. **General Torque Equation:** If the loop is allowed to rotate around a center axis, the torque equation becomes dependent on the angle between the loop's normal and the B field:
    T = *l*IBd cos φ

    Where:
        *   *l* is the length of sides a-b and c-d.
        *   φ is the angle from <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span>.
   The direction is determined by the Right Hand Rule. Thus, we have the vector equation:
    <span style="text-decoration: overline">T</span> = <span style="text-decoration: overline">m</span> × <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span>

    Where <span style="text-decoration: overline">m</span> is the *magnetic dipole moment* of the loop:

    <span style="text-decoration: overline">m</span> = ldI<span style="text-decoration: overline">n</span>

    And <span style="text-decoration: overline">n</span> is the right-hand normal vector of the current loop.

## Faraday's Law and Lenz's Law

**Faraday's Law:**

A time-varying magnetic flux through a conductive loop induces a voltage (electromotive force, or EMF) around the loop. Faraday's Law quantifies this:

V<sub>ind</sub> = - (d/dt) ∫<sub>S</sub> <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span> ⋅ d<span style="text-decoration: overline">s</span> = - (dΦ/dt)

Where:

*   V<sub>ind</sub> is the induced voltage.
*   Φ is the magnetic flux through the loop.
*   The negative sign indicates the direction of the induced voltage (Lenz's Law).

**Lenz's Law:**

The induced voltage creates a current that produces a magnetic flux *opposing* the change in the original magnetic flux.  This is Lenz's Law – the induced effect opposes the cause.

**Faraday's and Lenz's Law Combined**:

Using the relationship between voltage and the electric field (V = ∮ <span style="text-decoration: overline">E</span> ⋅ d<span style="text-decoration: overline">l</span>) we can rewrite Faraday's law, and also incorporate Lenz's law:

∮<sub>C</sub> <span style="text-decoration: overline">E</span> ⋅ d<span style="text-decoration: overline">l</span> = - (d/dt) ∫<sub>S</sub> <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span> ⋅ d<span style="text-decoration: overline">s</span> = -(dΦ/dt)

## Motional and Transformer EMF

**Two Types of Induced EMF:**

There are two ways to induce an EMF in a loop:

1.  **Transformer EMF:**  This occurs when the magnetic field (<span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span>) *changes with time* while the loop is stationary.

    emf = - (d/dt) ∫<sub>S</sub> <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span> ⋅ d<span style="text-decoration: overline">s</span>

2.  **Motional EMF:**  This occurs when a conductive loop *moves* through a *static* magnetic field.  This is due to the Lorentz force acting on the moving charges within the conductor.

    emf<sub>motional</sub> = ∮<sub>C</sub> (<span style="text-decoration: overline">v</span> × <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span>) ⋅ d<span style="text-decoration: overline">l</span>

    Where <span style="text-decoration: overline">v</span> is the velocity of the conductor.

**Total EMF:**

The total EMF is the sum of the transformer and motional EMFs:

emf<sub>total</sub> = - ∫<sub>S</sub> (d<span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span>/dt) ⋅ d<span style="text-decoration: overline">s</span> + ∮<sub>C</sub> (<span style="text-decoration: overline">v</span> × <span style="text-decoration: overline">B</span>) ⋅ d<span style="text-decoration: overline">l</span>

This equation combines both Faraday's Law (the time derivative of the flux) and the effect of motion in a magnetic field.

Okay, here's a meticulously detailed and exhaustively comprehensive set of notes derived from the provided Ansys electromagnetics course PPT content, focusing on "Electrostatic Material Interaction."  I'll use Markdown primarily, with HTML where necessary for equation formatting and clarity.

# Electrostatic Material Interaction

These notes are based on the Ansys course material developed by Kathryn L. Smith, PhD.

## Sources (Slide 2)

The material presented in this course is based on the following textbooks:

*   **Elements of Electromagnetics**, by Matthew N.O. Sadiku, 5th ed. (2010)
*   **Engineering Electromagnetics**, by Nathan Ida, 3rd ed. (2015)
*   **Microwave Engineering**, by David Pozar, 4th ed. (2012)

These are considered standard, reputable textbooks in the field of electromagnetics, providing a solid theoretical foundation.

## Agenda (Slide 3)

This course addresses the interaction between electrostatic fields and materials.  The agenda covers these key topics:

1.  **The Constitutive Relation and Boundary Conditions:** This will define how materials respond to electric fields and how fields behave at the interfaces between different materials.
2.  **Updating the free-space equations:**  This section will show how the familiar equations for electrostatics in free space (vacuum) are modified to account for the presence of materials.
3.  **Capacitance:**  This will define capacitance, a crucial concept in electrostatics, and provide methods for calculating it in various configurations.

**Core Concept Introduction:**

The slide begins with a crucial distinction:

*   **Free Space:** In a vacuum (free space), the electric field (**E**) and electric flux density (**D**) are related by the simple equation:
    ```
    D = ε₀E
    ```
    where ε₀ is the permittivity of free space (a fundamental constant).

*   **Materials:**  Engineers rarely work with pure vacuums.  Instead, they use *materials* (dielectrics and conductors) to manipulate electric fields.  Therefore, understanding how materials affect electrostatic fields is *essential*.

## Boundary Conditions for the Electric Field (Slides 4-9)

This section is the heart of understanding how electric fields behave at the interface between two different materials.

**Key Idea (Slide 4):**

When an electric field encounters a boundary between two materials with different permittivities (ε<sub>r1</sub> ≠ ε<sub>r2</sub>), the field changes.  To analyze this, we decompose the electric field vector into two components:

*   **Tangential Component (E<sub>t</sub>):**  Parallel to the boundary surface.
*   **Normal Component (E<sub>n</sub>):** Perpendicular to the boundary surface.

**Derivation of Tangential Boundary Condition (Slides 5 & 6):**

*   **Faraday's Law:**  The derivation uses Faraday's Law of induction, which, in its integral form, states that the circulation of the electric field around a closed loop is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop.  For electrostatics (time-invariant fields), the magnetic flux is zero. The equation is:

    ```html
    ∮<sub>abcd</sub> <b>E</b> ⋅ d<b>l</b> = -d/dt ∫<sub>S</sub> <b>B</b> ⋅ d<b>s</b> = 0 (for electrostatics)
    ```
*    **Contour Selection:** A rectangular loop (abcd) is chosen, straddling the boundary.  The loop is infinitesimally thin in the direction perpendicular to the boundary.
*   **Applying Faraday's Law:**  As the height of the rectangle approaches zero, the contributions from the normal components of the electric field (E<sub>1n</sub> and E<sub>2n</sub>) become negligible. The area of the loop also goes to zero, eliminating the magnetic flux term (which is already zero in electrostatics).
*   **Result:**  Only the tangential components remain, leading to:

    ```
    E<sub>1t</sub> - E<sub>2t</sub> = 0  =>  E<sub>1t</sub> = E<sub>2t</sub>
    ```

*   **Conclusion:**  The *tangential component of the electric field is continuous* across the boundary. This is a fundamental boundary condition.

**Derivation of Normal Boundary Condition (Slides 7 & 8):**

*   **Gauss's Law:**  This derivation uses Gauss's Law, which states that the total electric flux out of a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge.

    ```html
     ∮<sub>S</sub> <b>D</b> ⋅ d<b>s</b> = ∫<sub>V</sub> ρ<sub>v</sub> dv = Q<sub>encl</sub>
    ```
    Where:
     *  `D` is the electric flux density.
     * `ds` is an infinitesimal area vector on the closed surface.
     * `ρv` is the volume charge density.
     * `dv` is an infinitesimal volume element.
     *  `Q<sub>encl</sub>` is the total charge enclosed by the surface.

*   **Surface Selection:** A small, cylindrical "pillbox" is used as the Gaussian surface.  It straddles the boundary, with its top and bottom surfaces parallel to the boundary.

*   **Applying Gauss's Law:** As the height of the cylinder approaches zero, the contributions from the tangential components of the electric flux density (D<sub>1t</sub> and D<sub>2t</sub>) cancel out because they contribute equally and oppositely to the flux through the sides of the cylinder.

*   **Surface Charge Density (ρ<sub>s</sub>):**  The key here is the presence of a *surface charge density* (ρ<sub>s</sub>) on the boundary. This is charge per unit area residing *on* the interface.

*   **Result:** Only the normal components remain, leading to:

    ```
    D<sub>n1</sub> - D<sub>n2</sub> = ρ<sub>s</sub>
    ```

*   **Using the Constitutive Relation (D = εE):**  Substituting  `D = εE`, we get:

    ```
    ε<sub>1</sub>E<sub>1n</sub> - ε<sub>2</sub>E<sub>2n</sub> = ρ<sub>s</sub>
    ```

*   **Conclusion:**  The *normal component of the electric flux density (D) is discontinuous* across the boundary by an amount equal to the surface charge density. The normal component of the *electric field (E)* is discontinuous, with the discontinuity determined by both the surface charge density and the permittivities of the materials.

**Summary of Boundary Conditions (Slide 9):**

The two crucial boundary conditions are:

1.  **Tangential:**  E<sub>1t</sub> = E<sub>2t</sub>
2.  **Normal:** ε<sub>1</sub>E<sub>1n</sub> - ε<sub>2</sub>E<sub>2n</sub> = ρ<sub>s</sub>

These conditions are *always* true at any interface between two materials in an electrostatic field.

## Updating Free-Space Equations (Slide 10)

This section explains how to modify equations derived for free space (vacuum) to account for the presence of materials.

**Key Principle:**

*   **Scale Permittivity:** All equations valid in free space remain valid in a linear, homogeneous, isotropic material if we replace the permittivity of free space (ε₀) with the permittivity of the material (ε = ε₀ε<sub>r</sub>), where ε<sub>r</sub> is the relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of the material.

**Examples:**

*   **Force between two charges:**
    *   Free Space:  F = (Q₁Q₂) / (4πε₀R²) * a<sub>R12</sub>
    *   Material:   F = (Q₁Q₂) / (4πε₀ε<sub>r</sub>R²) * a<sub>R12</sub>

*   **Voltage due to a point charge:**
    *   Free Space: V = Q₁ / (4πε₀r₁)
    *   Material:  V = Q₁ / (4πε₀ε<sub>r</sub>r₁)

*   **Electrostatic Energy Density:**
    *  Free Space: w<sub>E</sub> = (1/2)ε₀E²
    *   Material: w<sub>E</sub> = (1/2)ε₀ε<sub>r</sub>E² = (1/2)DE

    *Important Note:* The energy density *increases* in a dielectric material for the same electric field strength. This is because the material stores energy by polarization.

**Explanation of Material Polarization (Implicit in the slide):**

*   **Dielectrics:**  When a dielectric material is placed in an electric field, its molecules become *polarized*.  This means that the positive and negative charges within the molecules are slightly displaced, creating tiny electric dipoles.
*   **Effect on Field:**  These dipoles align themselves with the external field, effectively *reducing* the electric field strength *inside* the dielectric.  This reduction is quantified by the relative permittivity (ε<sub>r</sub>), which is always greater than 1 for dielectrics.
*  **Bound Charge:** The polarization creates "bound charges" within the dielectric, which contribute to the overall electric field.

## Capacitance (Slides 11-16)

This section defines capacitance and provides methods for calculating it.

**Definition (Slide 11):**

*   **Capacitance (C):**  The ratio of the magnitude of the charge (Q) on either conductor of a two-conductor system to the magnitude of the potential difference (V) between the conductors.

    ```
    C = Q / V
    ```

*   **Units:** Farads (F). 1 Farad = 1 Coulomb/Volt.

**Parallel Plate Capacitor Example (Slides 11 & 14):**

*   **Setup:**  Two parallel, conductive plates of area A, separated by a distance d, with a dielectric of permittivity ε between them.
*   **Derivation (using charge):**
    1.  **Assume Charges:** Place a charge +Q on one plate and -Q on the other.
    2.  **Apply Gauss's Law:**  Assuming negligible fringing fields (fields extending beyond the edges of the plates), Gauss's Law is applied to a Gaussian surface enclosing one plate. This gives:

        ```html
        Q<sub>encl</sub> = +Q = ∫∫ εE ⋅ ds = εE ∫∫ ds = εEA
        ```
        Where:
         * `E` is the magnitude of the (uniform) electric field between the plates.
         * The integral of `ds` over the plate area is simply `A`.

    3.  **Solve for E:** E = Q / (εA) (Note: The PPT uses a slightly different form, explicitly integrating, but this is the simplified and equivalent result). The direction is from the positive to the negative plate, so with a z-axis defined as pointing from positive to negative:

        ```
        E = -(Q / (εA)) * a<sub>z</sub>
        ```
    4.  **Calculate Voltage:** V = -∫E ⋅ dl.  Integrating from the bottom plate (negative) to the top plate (positive) along a straight line (distance d):

        ```
        V = -∫<sub>0</sub><sup>d</sup> -(Q / (εA)) dz = Qd / (εA)
        ```

    5.  **Calculate Capacitance:** C = Q/V = Q / (Qd / (εA)) = εA / d

        ```
        C = εA / d = ε₀ε<sub>r</sub>A / d
        ```

*   **Derivation (using voltage) (Slide 15):**
    1.  **Assume Voltage:** Apply a potential difference V between the plates.
    2.  **Calculate E:** Assuming negligible fringing, the electric field is uniform: E = -∇V = (V/d) * a<sub>z</sub>.
    3.  **Apply Gauss's Law:** Using Gauss's Law (as above) and substituting for E, we get the charge on the top plate.
        `Q = εEA = ε(V/d)A = εAV/d`
    4. **Calculate C:** C = Q/V = (εAV/d) / V = εA/d, the same result as above.

**General Procedure for Calculating Capacitance (Slide 12):**

1.  **Charge Method:**
    *   Place a test charge +Q on one conductor and -Q on the other (if there are two conductors). If there's only *one* conductor, imagine the other conductor is at infinity.
    *   Calculate the electric field **E** resulting from these charges (using Gauss's Law or other techniques).
    *   Calculate the voltage V between the conductors by integrating the electric field: V = -∫E ⋅ dl.
    *   Calculate capacitance: C = Q/V.

2.  **Voltage Method (Slide 13):**
    *   Apply a test voltage V between the conductors (or assume a potential difference if there's only one conductor).
    *   Calculate the electric field **E** resulting from this voltage (often using E = -∇V).
    *   Calculate the charge Q on one of the conductors (using Gauss's Law or the relationship D = εE).
    *   Calculate capacitance: C = Q/V.

**Energy Stored in a Capacitor (Slide 16):**

*   **Derivation from a system of charges:** The energy stored in a system of N charges is given by:
     ```
     W<sub>E</sub> = (1/2) ∑<sub>k=1</sub><sup>N</sup> Q<sub>k</sub>V<sub>k</sub>
     ```

*   **For a Capacitor:**  Since Q = CV, and the voltage across the capacitor is V, and the charges on the two plates are +Q and -Q, we can express the energy stored in a single capacitor in several equivalent forms:

    ```
    W = (1/2)CV² = (1/2)QV = Q² / (2C)
    ```

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Boundary Conditions:**  The tangential component of the electric field is continuous across a boundary, while the normal component of the electric flux density is discontinuous by an amount equal to the surface charge density.
*   **Material Effects:**  The presence of a dielectric material reduces the electric field strength inside the material and increases the energy density for a given field strength.
*   **Capacitance:**  Capacitance is a measure of a system's ability to store charge.  It depends on the geometry of the conductors and the permittivity of the material between them.
*   **Energy Storage:**  Capacitors store energy in the electric field between their conductors.

This detailed explanation covers all the slides, elaborating on the core concepts and providing a thorough understanding of electrostatic material interaction. This level of detail should be more than sufficient for understanding the course content.

Okay, here are meticulously detailed notes from the Ansys electromagnetics course PPT content, covering magnetostatics in free space. I've used Markdown primarily, with HTML where needed for clearer equation formatting or to improve presentation.

# Magnetostatics in Free Space - Ansys Innovation Course

## Sources (Slide 2)

The course material is drawn from these three primary texts:

*   **"Elements of Electromagnetics"** by Matthew N.O. Sadiku, 5th ed. (2010)
*   **"Engineering Electromagnetics"** by Nathan Ida, 3rd ed. (2015)
*   **"Microwave Engineering"** by David Pozar, 4th ed. (2012)

These are standard, well-regarded textbooks in the field, providing a strong foundation for the concepts covered.

## Introduction to Magnetic Fields (Slides 3, 4, 5, 6)

### Fundamental Concepts and Definitions

Before delving into the mechanics of magnetic fields, we establish crucial definitions:

*   **Electromagnetic Constant (μ₀):** This is the magnetic permeability of free space. It represents the ability of a vacuum to support the formation of a magnetic field.  Its value is:

    μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m (Henrys per meter)

*   **Fundamental Magnetic Fields:**

    *   **Magnetic Field Intensity (H):**  Measured in Amperes per meter (A/m). It is related to the *cause* of the magnetic field, namely the current.
    *   **Magnetic Flux Density (B):** Measured in Tesla (T).  This is a vector field that describes the magnetic force that would be exerted on a moving charge. It represents the *effect* of the magnetic field.

    *   **Relationship in Vacuum:** In a vacuum (and for the scope of this course, we will primarily focus on free space), the magnetic flux density (B) and magnetic field intensity (H) are directly proportional, linked by the permeability of free space (μ₀):

        ```html
        <p><b>B</b> = μ<sub>0</sub><b>H</b></p>
        ```

*   **Fundamental Field Sources:**

    *   **Electric Charge (Q):** Measured in Coulombs (C).  Stationary charges produce electric fields.
    *   **Electric Current Density (J):** Measured in Amperes per meter squared (A/m²). This represents the flow of electric charge, and *moving* charges are the source of magnetic fields.

### Magnetic Flux

*   **Magnetic Flux Density (B)**, as previously stated, is the key vector field. It exerts a force on moving charges.
*   **Magnetic Flux (Ψ):**  This is a *scalar* quantity that represents the total amount of magnetic field "passing through" a given surface (S).  It is calculated by integrating the magnetic flux density over the surface:

    ```html
    <p>Ψ = ∫<sub>S</sub> <b>B</b> ⋅ d<b>s</b></p>
    ```

    *   `d<b>s</b>` is a differential area vector, perpendicular to the surface at each point.
    *   The dot product (`⋅`) means that only the component of **B** perpendicular to the surface contributes to the flux.
    *   The units of magnetic flux are Webers (Wb), where 1 Wb = 1 T⋅m².
    *   Intuitively, magnetic flux measures how much of the magnetic field is "caught" by the surface.

### Origin of Magnetic Fields

Magnetic fields originate from moving electric charges.  The PPT illustrates two key scenarios:

1.  **Electric Current:** A flow of charge (current) in a wire generates a magnetic field that circles the wire. The direction of the field lines is given by the right-hand rule (thumb points in the direction of conventional current, fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field).
2.  **Electrons Orbiting Atoms:** The orbital motion of electrons within atoms also constitutes a current, creating tiny magnetic dipoles.  In many materials, these dipoles are randomly oriented, resulting in no net magnetic field.  However, in ferromagnetic materials (like iron), these dipoles can align, leading to a strong, permanent magnetic field.

**Important Note:** The PPT also mentions that changing electric fields can *also* create magnetic fields.  This is a crucial aspect of electromagnetism (covered by Faraday's Law of Induction), but it's not the focus of this *magnetostatics* course, which deals with *steady* currents and *static* magnetic fields.

## Magnetic Monopoles and Dipoles (Slides 7, 8, 9)

### Monopoles

*   **Definition:** A monopole is a point from which field lines either exclusively diverge (a source) or exclusively converge (a sink).

*   **Electrostatics vs. Magnetostatics:**
    *   **Electrostatics:** Electric monopoles *do* exist. They are simply isolated positive or negative charges.  Electric field lines originate from positive charges and terminate on negative charges.
    *   **Magnetostatics:** *Magnetic monopoles have never been observed.*  There is no experimental evidence for their existence.  This is a fundamental difference between electric and magnetic fields.

### Dipoles

*   **Definition:** A dipole consists of two equal and opposite poles separated by a distance.
*   **Electric Dipoles:** Can be formed by a positive and a negative charge separated by a small distance.
*   **Magnetic Dipoles:** The *lowest-order* magnetic configuration.  Because magnetic monopoles don't exist, magnetic fields *always* form closed loops.
*   **Field Line Behavior:**  Magnetic field lines form closed loops, emerging from the "north" pole and entering the "south" pole *externally*.  *Internally*, the field lines continue from the south pole back to the north pole, completing the loop. This is clearly illustrated in the slide showing the close-up view of the magnet.

## The Solenoidal Law (Slide 10)

This law is a direct consequence of the non-existence of magnetic monopoles. It states that magnetic fields are *solenoidal*, meaning they have no divergence.

*   **Point Form:**

    ```html
    <p>∇ ⋅ <b>B</b> = 0</p>
    ```
    This states that the divergence of the magnetic flux density is always zero *at every point in space*.  There are no sources or sinks of magnetic field lines.

*   **Integral Form:**

    ```html
    <p>∮<sub>S</sub> <b>B</b> ⋅ d<b>s</b> = 0</p>
    ```
    This states that the net magnetic flux through *any closed surface* is always zero.  Any magnetic field lines that enter a closed surface must also exit it. This is the magnetic equivalent of Gauss's Law for electric fields, but with a crucial difference: the integral is *always* zero for magnetic fields, unlike the electric case where it's proportional to the enclosed charge.

*   **Implication:** The total "magnetic charge" enclosed by any closed surface is always zero. This reinforces the non-existence of magnetic monopoles.

## Ampere's Law in a Vacuum (Slides 11, 12, 13)

Ampere's Law relates the magnetic field around a closed loop to the electric current passing through that loop.  It's a fundamental law for calculating magnetic fields due to steady currents.

*   **Point Form:**

    ```html
    <p>∇ × <b>B</b> = μ<sub>0</sub><b>J</b></p>
    ```
    This states that the curl of the magnetic flux density is proportional to the current density.  The curl describes the "circulation" of a vector field.

*   **Integral Form (Ampere's Circuital Law):**

    ```html
    <p>∮<sub>C</sub> <b>B</b> ⋅ d<b>l</b> = μ<sub>0</sub>I<sub>tot</sub></p>
    ```
    *   `∮<sub>C</sub>`:  Line integral around a closed loop C.
    *   `<b>B</b> ⋅ d<b>l</b>`:  The dot product of the magnetic field with a differential length element along the loop.  This picks out the component of **B** that's *tangent* to the loop.
    *   `μ<sub>0</sub>`: Permeability of free space.
    *   `I<sub>tot</sub>`: The *total* current enclosed by the loop C.  The direction of the current is determined by the right-hand rule, relative to the direction of integration around the loop.

*   **Explanation:** The line integral of the magnetic field around a closed loop is directly proportional to the total current passing through *any* surface bounded by that loop.  This is a powerful tool for calculating magnetic fields in situations with high symmetry.

*   **Example (Slide 13):** The PPT implicitly discusses the magnetic field around an infinitely long, straight wire carrying a current `I<sub>tot</sub>`.  By choosing a circular loop of radius `r` centered on the wire, the magnetic field **B** is constant in magnitude and always tangent to the loop. This simplifies the line integral:

    ```html
    <p>∮<sub>C</sub> <b>B</b> ⋅ d<b>l</b> = B ∮<sub>C</sub> dl = B(2πr)</p>
    ```

    Applying Ampere's Law:

    ```html
    <p>B(2πr) = μ<sub>0</sub>I<sub>tot</sub></p>
    <p>B = (μ<sub>0</sub>I<sub>tot</sub>) / (2πr)</p>
    ```
    This shows the magnitude of the magnetic field decreases inversely with the distance from the wire.

*   **Notation (Slides 12 & 13):** The PPT uses the following notations:
    *   A circle with a dot inside (⊙): Represents a vector (e.g., current or magnetic field) pointing *out of the page*.
    *   A circle with a cross inside (⊗): Represents a vector pointing *into the page*.

## Magnetic Vector Potential (Slides 14, 15, 16)

The magnetic vector potential (A) is a mathematical tool that simplifies the calculation of magnetic fields, especially in complex situations.

*   **Motivation:**  Since `∇ ⋅ <b>B</b> = 0`, we can express **B** as the curl of another vector field, **A**:

    ```html
    <p><b>B</b> = ∇ × <b>A</b></p>
    ```
    This is always possible because the divergence of a curl is identically zero (`∇ ⋅ (∇ × <b>A</b>) = 0`).  **A** is called the magnetic vector potential.

*   **Derivation:**  Substituting this definition into Ampere's Law (`∇ × <b>B</b> = μ<sub>0</sub><b>J</b>`) gives:

    ```html
    <p>∇ × (∇ × <b>A</b>) = μ<sub>0</sub><b>J</b></p>
    ```

    Using the vector identity `∇ × (∇ × <b>A</b>) = ∇(∇ ⋅ <b>A</b>) - ∇²<b>A</b>`, we get:

    ```html
    <p>∇(∇ ⋅ <b>A</b>) - ∇²<b>A</b> = μ<sub>0</sub><b>J</b></p>
    ```

*   **Gauge Freedom:**  The definition `<b>B</b> = ∇ × <b>A</b>` does *not* uniquely define **A**. We can add the gradient of any scalar field to **A** without changing **B** (because `∇ × (∇φ) = 0` for any scalar field φ). This is called "gauge freedom."

*   **Coulomb Gauge:**  To simplify the equation, we choose a specific gauge, the *Coulomb gauge*, where `∇ ⋅ <b>A</b> = 0`.  This leads to:

    ```html
    <p>∇²<b>A</b> = -μ<sub>0</sub><b>J</b></p>
    ```
    This is a vector Poisson equation, analogous to the scalar Poisson equation in electrostatics (`∇²V = -ρ/ε₀`).

*   **Solution:**  The solution to this equation in free space is:

    ```html
    <p><b>A</b>(<b>r</b>) = (μ<sub>0</sub> / 4π) ∫<sub>V'</sub> (<b>J</b>(<b>r'</b>) / |<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>|) dV'</p>
    ```
    *   `<b>r</b>`: Position vector of the observation point (where we want to find **A**).
    *   `<b>r'</b>`: Position vector of the source point (where the current density <b>J</b> is located).
    *   `|<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>|`: Distance between the observation point and the source point.
    *   `V'`: The volume containing the current distribution.
    *   `dV'`: Differential volume element.

*   **Procedure:** To find the magnetic field:
    1.  Calculate the magnetic vector potential **A** using the integral above.
    2.  Calculate the magnetic flux density **B** by taking the curl of **A**:  `<b>B</b> = ∇ × <b>A</b>`.

## Magnetic Force Law (Slides 17, 18, 19)

This law describes the force experienced by a moving charge or a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field.

*   **Force on a Moving Charge:**

    ```html
    <p><b>F</b><sub>m</sub> = q<b>u</b> × <b>B</b></p>
    ```
    *   `q`: Charge of the particle.
    *   `<b>u</b>`: Velocity of the particle.
    *   `<b>B</b>`: Magnetic flux density.
    *   `×`: Cross product.  The force is perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field, and its direction is given by the right-hand rule.

*   **Lorentz Force Law:**  This is the *total* electromagnetic force on a charged particle, combining both electric and magnetic forces:

    ```html
    <p><b>F</b> = q(<b>E</b> + <b>u</b> × <b>B</b>)</p>
    ```
    *   `<b>E</b>`: Electric field.

*   **Force on a Current-Carrying Wire:**

    ```html
    <p>d<b>F</b><sub>m</sub> = I d<b>l</b> × <b>B</b></p>
    ```
    *   `I`: Current in the wire.
    *   `d<b>l</b>`: Differential length element along the wire, pointing in the direction of the current.
    *   This equation is derived from the force on a moving charge by considering a small segment of wire.  The charge `q` and velocity `<b>u</b>` are replaced by the current `I` and the length element `d<b>l</b>`.

## Biot-Savart's Law (Slides 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25)

Biot-Savart's Law provides a direct way to calculate the magnetic field generated by a steady current distribution, without explicitly using the magnetic vector potential. It's derived from Ampere's Law and the magnetic force law.

*   **Setup:** Consider two current loops (Loop 1 and Loop 2).
*   **Derivation (Conceptual):**
    1.  Current `I₁` in Loop 1 creates a magnetic field `<b>B</b>₁`.
    2.  A current element `I₂d<b>l</b>₂` in Loop 2 experiences a force `d<b>F</b><sub>m21</sub>` due to `<b>B</b>₁`.
    3.  By combining Ampere's Law and the magnetic force law, and performing some vector calculus manipulations (not explicitly shown in the PPT, but implied), we arrive at the Biot-Savart Law.

*   **Biot-Savart Law (for a current element):**
    ```html
        d<b>F</b><sub>m21</sub> = I<sub>2</sub>d<b>l</b><sub>2</sub> × [μ<sub>0</sub>I<sub>1</sub>d<b>l</b><sub>1</sub> × <b>a</b><sub>r</sub> / (4πR<sup>2</sup>)]
    ```

*   **Biot-Savart Law (for calculating B):**

    ```html
    <p><b>B</b>(<b>r</b>) = (μ<sub>0</sub> / 4π) ∫<sub>L'</sub> (I d<b>l'</b> × (<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>)) / |<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>|³</p>
    ```
    *  `<b>r</b>`: Position vector of the observation point (where you want to find the field).
    *   `<b>r'</b>`: Position vector of the source point (location of the current element `Id<b>l'</b>`).
    *   `|<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>|`:  Distance between the observation point and the source point.
    *   `d<b>l'</b>`: Differential length element of the current-carrying wire.
    *   `L'`:  The path along the current-carrying wire.
    *   `×`: Cross product. The direction of `d<b>l'</b> × (<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>)` is determined by the right-hand rule, and it gives the direction of the magnetic field contribution from that current element.
    *   The integral sums up the contributions from all the current elements along the wire.

*   **General Form (for a volume current density):**

    ```html
    <p><b>B</b>(<b>r</b>) = (μ<sub>0</sub> / 4π) ∫<sub>V'</sub> (<b>J</b>(<b>r'</b>) × (<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>)) / |<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>|³ dV'</p>
    ```
    *   `<b>J</b>(<b>r'</b>)`: Current density at the source point.
    *   `V'`: Volume containing the current distribution.
    *   `dV'`: Differential volume element.

*   **Key Point:** Biot-Savart's Law is valid only for *time-invariant* (steady) currents.

## Magnetic Scalar Potential (Slide 26)

In regions where the current density `<b>J</b>` is zero, we can define a magnetic scalar potential `V<sub>m</sub>`, analogous to the electric potential `V` in electrostatics.

*   **Condition:**  This is only valid in regions where `<b>J</b> = 0`.  If `<b>J</b> ≠ 0`, we *must* use the magnetic vector potential **A**.

*   **Definition:**

    ```html
    <p><b>B</b> = -μ<sub>0</sub>∇V<sub>m</sub></p>
    ```
     (This can also be written in terms of **H**:  **H** = -∇V<sub>m</sub>)
    *   `V<sub>m</sub>`: Magnetic scalar potential.  Its units are Amperes (A).

*   **Analogy to Electrostatics:**  This is analogous to the electric field being the negative gradient of the electric potential: `<b>E</b> = -∇V`.

*   **Usefulness:** In current-free regions, the magnetic scalar potential can simplify calculations because it's a scalar field, rather than a vector field like **A**.  However, its limited applicability (only where `<b>J</b> = 0`) makes the magnetic vector potential **A** more generally useful.

## Page 3: Introduction to Electric Fields - Definitions

This slide introduces fundamental concepts and definitions essential for understanding electrostatics.

**Electromagnetic Constants:**

*   **ε<sub>0</sub> (Electric Permittivity of Free Space):**  Equal to 8.854 x 10<sup>-12</sup> Farads per meter (F/m). This constant represents the ability of a vacuum to permit electric field lines.  It's a measure of how easily an electric field can be established in free space.  A higher permittivity means a stronger electric field for a given charge distribution.
*   **c (Speed of Light in a Vacuum):** Equal to 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> meters per second (m/s).  While seemingly unrelated to electrostatics at first glance, the speed of light is intrinsically linked to electromagnetic phenomena.  It's related to the permittivity and permeability of free space by the equation:  c = 1/√(ε<sub>0</sub>μ<sub>0</sub>), where μ<sub>0</sub> is the permeability of free space (not discussed in this specific slide, but relevant to magnetostatics).
*   **e (Charge of an Electron):** Equal to -1.6019 x 10<sup>-19</sup> Coulombs (C).  This is the fundamental unit of electric charge.  All observable charges are integer multiples of this value (either positive or negative).

**Fundamental Electric Fields:**

*   **E (Electric Field):**  Has units of volts per meter (V/m).  The electric field is a vector field that describes the force experienced by a unit positive charge at a given point in space.  It points in the direction that a positive charge would move if placed at that point.
*   **D (Electric Flux Density):**  Has units of Coulombs per meter squared (C/m<sup>2</sup>).  The electric flux density is related to the electric field, but it is independent of the medium. It represents the number of electric field lines passing through a unit area.
*   **Relationship between D and E (in a vacuum):**  D = ε<sub>0</sub>E. This equation states that, in free space, the electric flux density is directly proportional to the electric field, with the constant of proportionality being the permittivity of free space.

**Fundamental Field Sources:**

*   **Q (Electric Charge):** Has units of Coulombs (C).  Electric charge is the fundamental source of electric fields.  Stationary charges produce electrostatic fields.
*   **J (Electric Current Density):**  Has units of Amperes per meter squared (A/m<sup>2</sup>).  Electric current density represents the flow of charge per unit area. While this is related to *moving* charges, it's included here likely for completeness in defining fundamental electromagnetic quantities.

## Page 4: Introduction to Electric Fields - Conceptual Visualization

This slide provides a visual and conceptual understanding of electric fields.

*   **Concept:** An electric field (E) is a vector field that exerts a force on charges.
*   **Visualization:**  A positive point charge is shown, with red arrows radiating outward representing the electric field lines.  These lines indicate the direction of the force that a positive test charge would experience at various points around the source charge.  The density of the lines (how close together they are) is qualitatively related to the strength of the electric field.
*   **Electron in the Field:** A small electron is shown near the positive charge, with a force vector (F) pointing towards the positive charge. This illustrates the attractive force between opposite charges.
*   **Explanation:** The electron experiences an attractive force because it's in the electric field created by the positive charge. The electric field mediates the interaction between the charges.

## Page 5: Introduction to Electric Fields - Analogy to Gravity

This slide draws an analogy between electric fields and gravitational fields.

*   **Concept:** Both electric and gravitational fields are vector fields that exert forces on objects.
*   **Gravitational Field:** Depicted by a cartoon Earth with yellow arrows pointing inwards, representing the gravitational field lines. These lines show the direction of the force that a mass would experience.
*   **Rocket in the Field:** A rocket is shown above the Earth, with a force vector (F) pointing downwards, indicating the gravitational force acting on it.
*   **Explanation:** The rocket experiences a downward force due to the Earth's gravitational field. This is analogous to the electron experiencing a force in the electric field. The analogy highlights the fundamental similarity: fields mediate forces between objects (charges in the case of electric fields, masses in the case of gravitational fields).

## Page 6: Charge

This slide defines charge and illustrates the electric fields produced by positive and negative charges.

*   **Definition:** Charge is a fundamental property of matter that creates electric fields.
*   **Positive Charge:**  Creates an outward-pointing electric field. This is visualized by a vector field plot showing arrows pointing radially outward from a central positive charge (+Q).
*   **Negative Charge:** Creates an inward-pointing electric field. This is visualized by a similar vector field plot, but with arrows pointing radially inward towards a central negative charge (-Q).
* **Key Point:** The direction of the electric field lines indicates the direction of the force on a *positive* test charge.

## Page 7: Coulomb's Law: Force

This slide presents Coulomb's Law, which quantifies the force between two point charges.

*   **Coulomb's Law (Equation):**

    ```html
    F<sub>1</sub> = -F<sub>2</sub> = - (Q<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>2</sub> / (4πε<sub>0</sub>R<sup>2</sup>)) * â<sub>R12</sub>
    ```
    *   **F<sub>1</sub>:** Force experienced by charge 1 (in Newtons, N).
    *   **F<sub>2</sub>:** Force experienced by charge 2 (in Newtons, N).
    *   **Q<sub>1</sub>:** Magnitude of the first point charge (in Coulombs, C).
    *   **Q<sub>2</sub>:** Magnitude of the second point charge (in Coulombs, C).
    *   **ε<sub>0</sub>:** Permittivity of free space (8.854 x 10<sup>-12</sup> F/m).
    *   **R:** Distance between the charges (in meters, m).
    *   **â<sub>R12</sub>:** Unit vector pointing from charge 1 *towards* charge 2.

*   **Explanation of Variables:** The slide meticulously defines each variable in the equation.

*   **Key Concept: Action-Reaction Pair:** The negative sign in F<sub>1</sub> = -F<sub>2</sub> indicates that the forces on the two charges are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, consistent with Newton's Third Law.

*   **Proportionality:** The force is directly proportional to the product of the charges (Q<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>2</sub>) and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them (R<sup>2</sup>). This is the *inverse-square law*.

* **Unit Vector:** The unit vector `â<sub>R12</sub>` is crucial. It defines the direction of the force.  It points *from* charge 1 *to* charge 2.

## Page 8: Coulomb's Law: Force (Vector Representation)

This slide illustrates Coulomb's Law with a vector diagram.

*   **Diagram:**  Two point charges, Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>, are shown in a coordinate system (x, y, z).  Position vectors r<sub>1</sub> and r<sub>2</sub> point from the origin to Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>, respectively.
*   **Force Vectors:**  F<sub>1</sub> (force on Q<sub>1</sub>) and F<sub>2</sub> (force on Q<sub>2</sub>) are shown.
*   **Distance Vector:** R represents the distance between the charges.
*   **Unit Vectors:** â<sub>R12</sub> (from Q<sub>1</sub> to Q<sub>2</sub>) and â<sub>R21</sub> (from Q<sub>2</sub> to Q<sub>1</sub>) are shown.
*   **Vector Definitions:**
    *   **R = |r<sub>2</sub> - r<sub>1</sub>|:** The magnitude of the distance between the charges is the magnitude of the difference between their position vectors.
    *   **â<sub>R12</sub> = (r<sub>2</sub> - r<sub>1</sub>) / |r<sub>2</sub> - r<sub>1</sub>| = (r<sub>2</sub> - r<sub>1</sub>) / R:** The unit vector is calculated by dividing the vector pointing from Q<sub>1</sub> to Q<sub>2</sub> by its magnitude.

*   **Key Idea:** This slide clarifies how to calculate the distance and unit vector when the charges are not conveniently located at the origin.

## Page 9: Coulomb's Law: Force (Attractive vs. Repulsive)

This slide clarifies the conditions for attractive and repulsive forces.

*   **Notes:**
    *   The forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (reiterating Newton's Third Law).
    *   **Attractive Force:** Occurs when Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub> have *opposite* signs (one positive, one negative).
    *   **Repulsive Force:** Occurs when Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub> have the *same* sign (both positive or both negative).
* **Simple Diagram:** Two pairs of charges are illustrated, one with opposite signs showing inward-pointing force vectors (attraction), and one with the same sign showing outward-pointing force vectors (repulsion).

## Page 10: Coulomb's Law: Electric Field

This slide shows how to derive the electric field from Coulomb's Law.

*   **Concept:** The electric field (E) at a point is the force per unit charge experienced by a test charge placed at that point.

*   **Equation:**

    ```html
    E = F / Q
    ```
    *   **E:** Electric field (V/m).
    *   **F:** Force on a test charge Q (N).
    *   **Q:** Magnitude of the test charge (C).

*   **Derivation:**  The electric field due to a point charge Q<sub>1</sub> at the origin is derived by considering the force on a test charge Q<sub>2</sub>:

    ```html
    E = F<sub>2</sub> / Q<sub>2</sub> = (Q<sub>1</sub> / (4πε<sub>0</sub>R<sup>2</sup>)) * â<sub>R</sub>
    ```
    *   **â<sub>R</sub>:** Unit vector pointing radially outward from Q<sub>1</sub>.
    *   **R:** Distance from Q<sub>1</sub> to the observation point P.

*   **Key Point:** The electric field is a property of the *source* charge (Q<sub>1</sub>) and the point in space (P), *independent* of the test charge (Q<sub>2</sub>).

## Page 11: Coulomb's Law: Electric Field (Generalization)

This slide generalizes the electric field equation for a point charge not at the origin.

*   **Diagram:**  A point charge Q<sub>1</sub> is located at position r'.  The observation point P is located at position r.
*   **Generalized Equation:**

    ```html
    E = (1 / (4πε<sub>0</sub>)) * (Q(r - r') / |r - r'|<sup>3</sup>)
    ```
    *   **r:** Position vector of the observation point.
    *   **r':** Position vector of the source charge Q.
    *   **|r - r'|:** Distance between the source charge and the observation point.
    *   **(r - r'):** Vector pointing from the source charge to the observation point.

*   **Key Idea:** This equation is a vector form of the electric field equation, valid for any location of the source charge. The denominator uses the cube of the distance, but the numerator also contains the distance vector, effectively resulting in an inverse-square law dependence on the magnitude.

## Page 12: Superposition

This slide introduces the principle of superposition for electric fields.

*   **Concept:** The total electric field at a point due to multiple charges is the *vector sum* of the electric fields due to each individual charge.
*   **Diagram:** Three charges (Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>2</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>) are shown.  The electric field vectors due to each charge (E<sub>Q1</sub>, E<sub>Q2</sub>, E<sub>Q3</sub>) are shown at a common point.
*   **Equation:**

    ```html
    E<sub>total</sub> = E<sub>Q1</sub> + E<sub>Q2</sub> + E<sub>Q3</sub>
    ```

*   **Key Principle:** Superposition is a fundamental principle in electromagnetics. It allows us to calculate the electric field in complex scenarios by breaking down the problem into simpler parts (the fields due to individual charges).  This principle holds true because Maxwell's equations, which govern electromagnetism, are linear.

## Page 13: Charge Density

This slide introduces the concept of charge density, which is used to describe continuous charge distributions.

*   **Concept:** Instead of dealing with discrete point charges, we often have charge distributed continuously over a line, surface, or volume.  Charge density simplifies the analysis in these cases.

*   **Types of Charge Density:**
    *   **Line Charge Density (ρ<sub>l</sub>):** Charge per unit length (C/m).  Used for charges distributed along a line (e.g., a wire).
        ```html
        Q<sub>tot</sub> = ∫<sub>l'</sub> ρ<sub>l</sub> dl'
        ```
    *   **Surface Charge Density (ρ<sub>s</sub>):** Charge per unit area (C/m<sup>2</sup>).  Used for charges distributed over a surface (e.g., a charged plate).
        ```html
        Q<sub>tot</sub> = ∫<sub>s'</sub> ρ<sub>s</sub> ds'
        ```
    *   **Volume Charge Density (ρ<sub>v</sub>):** Charge per unit volume (C/m<sup>3</sup>).  Used for charges distributed throughout a volume (e.g., a charged sphere).
        ```html
        Q<sub>tot</sub> = ∫<sub>v'</sub> ρ<sub>v</sub> dv'
        ```

*  **Integrals:** The total charge is found by integrating the appropriate charge density over the corresponding line, surface, or volume.

## Page 14: Coulomb's Law: Charge Density

This slide extends Coulomb's Law to calculate the electric field due to continuous charge distributions.

*   **Concept:**  The principle of superposition is applied to find the electric field due to continuous charge distributions.  We integrate the contributions from infinitesimal charge elements.

*   **Equations:**
    *   **For N point charge sources Q<sub>n</sub>:**

        ```html
        E = (1 / (4πε<sub>0</sub>)) * Σ<sub>n=1</sub><sup>N</sup> (Q<sub>n</sub>(r - r<sub>n</sub>') / |r - r<sub>n</sub>'|<sup>3</sup>)
        ```
        This is a discrete summation over all point charges.
    *   **For a line charge source ρ<sub>l</sub> distributed over l':**

        ```html
        E = (1 / (4πε<sub>0</sub>)) * ∫<sub>l'</sub> (ρ<sub>l</sub>(r - r') / |r - r'|<sup>3</sup>) dl'
        ```
    *   **For a surface charge source ρ<sub>s</sub> distributed over s':**

        ```html
        E = (1 / (4πε<sub>0</sub>)) * ∫<sub>s'</sub> (ρ<sub>s</sub>(r - r') / |r - r'|<sup>3</sup>) ds'
        ```
    *   **For a volume charge source ρ<sub>v</sub> distributed over v':**

        ```html
        E = (1 / (4πε<sub>0</sub>)) * ∫<sub>v'</sub> (ρ<sub>v</sub>(r - r') / |r - r'|<sup>3</sup>) dv'
        ```

*   **Key Point:** In each case, `r'` points to the infinitesimal charge element (dQ = ρ<sub>l</sub>dl', ρ<sub>s</sub>ds', or ρ<sub>v</sub>dv'), and `r` points to the observation point where the electric field is being calculated. The integration is performed over the entire charge distribution.

## Page 15: Electric Flux Density

This slide defines electric flux density (D) and its relationship to the electric field (E).

*  **Definition:** Electric flux density (D) is a vector field related to the electric field (E) by the material response of the medium.
*  **Technical Note (Convolution):**  In general, the relationship between D and E involves convolution because materials don't respond instantaneously to an applied field. This is a more advanced concept related to the time-varying behavior of materials in electromagnetic fields.
*   **Simplification for this Class (Vacuum):**  For the purposes of this introductory course and focusing on free space (vacuum), the relationship is simplified to:

    ```html
    D = ε<sub>0</sub>E
    ```

*   **Key Concept:** In a vacuum, D and E are directly proportional, with the constant of proportionality being the permittivity of free space (ε<sub>0</sub>). This makes calculations much simpler.

## Page 16: Gauss's Law

This slide introduces Gauss's Law, a fundamental law of electrostatics.

*   **Gauss's Law (Integral Form):**

    ```html
    Q<sub>encl</sub> = ∮<sub>S</sub> D ⋅ dS
    ```
    *   **Q<sub>encl</sub>:**  Total charge *enclosed* by a closed surface S.
    *   **∮<sub>S</sub>:**  Closed surface integral over surface S.
    *   **D:** Electric flux density.
    *   **dS:**  Differential area vector, pointing outward from the surface.

*   **Concept:** Gauss's Law states that the total electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge.
*   **Visualization:**
    *   **Positive Charge:** A point charge is shown.
    *   **Electric Field:**  The electric field lines emanating from the charge are shown.
    *   **Enclosing Surface:** A spherical surface (Gaussian surface) is shown enclosing the charge. The electric flux lines are shown passing through this surface.

*   **Key Idea:** Gauss's Law provides an alternative way to calculate the electric field, especially in situations with high symmetry. It relates the electric field on a closed surface to the total charge *inside* that surface.

## Page 17: Gauss's Law (Applications)

This slide shows how Gauss's Law can be used with different charge distributions.

*   **Integral Form of Gauss's Law (Repeated):**

    ```html
    Q<sub>encl</sub> = ∮<sub>S</sub> D ⋅ dS
    ```

*   **Applications to Different Charge Distributions:**
    *   **Line Charge Distribution:**

        ```html
        Q<sub>encl</sub> = ∮<sub>S</sub> D ⋅ dS = ∫<sub>l'</sub> ρ<sub>l</sub> dl'
        ```
    *   **Surface Charge Distribution:**

        ```html
        Q<sub>encl</sub> = ∮<sub>S</sub> D ⋅ dS = ∫<sub>s'</sub> ρ<sub>s</sub> ds'
        ```
    *   **Volume Charge Distribution:**

        ```html
        Q<sub>encl</sub> = ∮<sub>S</sub> D ⋅ dS = ∫<sub>v'</sub> ρ<sub>v</sub> dv'
        ```

*   **Key Concept:**  Gauss's Law can be used to find the electric field due to any charge distribution, but it's most useful when there's sufficient symmetry to simplify the surface integral. The right-hand side of the equations above represents the total enclosed charge, calculated using the appropriate charge density.

## Page 18: Gauss's Law (Differential Form)

This slide derives the differential form of Gauss's Law using the divergence theorem.

*   **Starting Point:** The integral form of Gauss's Law for a volume charge distribution:

    ```html
    Q<sub>encl</sub> = ∮<sub>S</sub> D ⋅ dS = ∫<sub>v'</sub> ρ<sub>v</sub> dv'
    ```

*   **Divergence Theorem:**

    ```html
    ∮<sub>S</sub> A ⋅ dS = ∫<sub>v</sub> ∇ ⋅ A dv
    ```
    *   This theorem relates a surface integral of a vector field (A) to a volume integral of the divergence of that field.

*   **Application of the Divergence Theorem:**  Applying the divergence theorem to the electric flux density (D):

    ```html
    Q<sub>encl</sub> = ∮<sub>S</sub> D ⋅ dS = ∫<sub>v'</sub> ρ<sub>v</sub> dv' = ∫<sub>v'</sub> ∇ ⋅ D dv'
    ```

*   **Differential Form of Gauss's Law:**  Since the volume integrals are equal for *any* arbitrary volume, the integrands must be equal:

    ```html
    ρ<sub>v</sub> = ∇ ⋅ D
    ```

*   **Key Concept:** This is the *differential* form of Gauss's Law. It relates the divergence of the electric flux density at a point to the volume charge density at that same point.  It's a *local* relationship, unlike the integral form, which is a *global* relationship.

## Page 19: Electric Work

This slide discusses the work done in moving a charge in an electric field.

*   **Concept:** Moving a charged particle against the electric force requires work.
*   **Work-Energy Theorem:** Work done is equal to the force multiplied by the displacement.
*   **Equation:**

    ```html
    W = -∫<sub>A</sub><sup>B</sup> F ⋅ dl
    ```
    *   **W:** Work done (in Joules, J).
    *   **F:** Force on the charge (N).
    *   **dl:**  Infinitesimal displacement vector along the path.
    *   **A:** Starting point.
    *   **B:** Ending point.
    *   **Negative Sign:**  Indicates that the work done is *against* the electric force.

*   **Diagram:**  A charge Q is shown moving from point A to point B along a path, with an infinitesimal displacement dl.  The force F on the charge due to the electric field is also shown.

*   **Convention:**
    *   **Negative Work:** Done *by* the electric field (charge moves in the direction of the electric force).
    *   **Positive Work:**  Done *by* an external force (charge moves against the electric force).

*   **Potential Energy:** The work done represents a change in the potential energy of the system.

## Page 20: Electric Potential

This slide defines electric potential (voltage).

*   **Definition:** Electric potential (or voltage) is the energy per unit charge gained or lost by moving a charge between two points in an electric field.
*  **Potential Energy Equation:**
     Potential Energy = (Work / Charge) = (Force x Displacement) / Charge

*   **Equation for Potential Difference (V<sub>AB</sub>):**

    ```html
    V<sub>AB</sub> = W/Q = -(1/Q) ∫<sub>A</sub><sup>B</sup> F ⋅ dl
    ```
    *  **V<sub>AB</sub>:**  Potential difference between points B and A (in Volts, V).
    * **W:** Work Done.
    * **Q:** Charge
    * **F:** Force on charge.
    * **dl:** Infinitesimal displacement vector.

*  **Relationship with electric field:**
    ```
    F = QE
    ```
     Substituting this equation into the equation for Potential Difference, yields:

    ```html
    V<sub>AB</sub> = -∫<sub>A</sub><sup>B</sup> E ⋅ dl
    ```

*   **Key Concept:** Electric potential is a scalar quantity, unlike the electric field (which is a vector). It represents the potential energy per unit charge at a point in space *relative to a reference point*.

## Page 21: Electric Potential (Path Independence)

This slide emphasizes the path independence of electric potential.

*   **Key Concept:**  The electric potential difference between two points is *independent of the path* taken between those points. This is a consequence of the electric field being *conservative* (its curl is zero, as will be shown later).

*   **Diagram:**  Points A, B, and C are shown, with different paths connecting them.

*   **Equation:**

    ```html
    V<sub>AB</sub> = V<sub>AC</sub> + V<sub>CB</sub>
    ```
    This shows that the potential difference between A and B is the same whether you go directly from A to B or via point C.

*   **Implication:** This property makes electric potential a very useful concept because we don't need to worry about the specific path taken when calculating potential differences.

## Page 22: Electric Potential (Reference at Infinity)

This slide discusses the common practice of defining the reference point for electric potential at infinity.

*   **Convention:**  Voltage is often measured relative to a reference point at infinity, where the electric field is assumed to be zero.
* **Equation and Derivation**
    * The general equation for potential difference between two points A and B is stated.
    ```
    V<sub>AB</sub> = -∫<sub>A</sub><sup>B</sup> E ⋅ dl
    ```
    * The electric field due to a point charge Q1 at the origin is given by:
    ```
     E = (Q<sub>1</sub>/(4πε<sub>0</sub>r<sup>2</sup>))*âr
    ```
    * dl = dr, where r is the radial distance. Substituting this into the potential difference equation gives:
    ```
     V<sub>AB</sub>= -∫<sub>∞</sub><sup>r1</sup> E ⋅ dr = -∫<sub>∞</sub><sup>r1</sup> (Q<sub>1</sub>/(4πε<sub>0</sub>r<sup>2</sup>))*âr ⋅ dr
    ```
    * Solving the integral gives:

    ```html
    V<sub>AB</sub> = (Q<sub>1</sub> / (4πε<sub>0</sub>r<sub>1</sub>)) = V<sub>B</sub>
    ```
    * The subscript "AB" is used to denote the voltage *at point B relative to a point A*.

*   **Key Idea:**  By setting the potential at infinity to zero, we can define the absolute potential at any point in space due to a charge distribution.

## Page 23: Electric Potential: Charge Density

This slide extends the concept of electric potential to continuous charge distributions.

* **Concept:**
The electric potential at point P, resulting from any distribution of charges, can be found by applying the principle of superposition, as it was the case with Coulomb's Law.
*   **Equations:**
    *   **For a point charge source Q:**

        ```html
        V = (1 / (4πε<sub>0</sub>)) * (Q / |r - r'|)
        ```
    *   **For a line charge source ρ<sub>l</sub> distributed over l':**

        ```html
        V = (1 / (4πε<sub>0</sub>)) * ∫<sub>l'</sub> (ρ<sub>l</sub> / |r - r'|) dl'
        ```
    *   **For a surface charge source ρ<sub>s</sub> distributed over s':**

        ```html
        V = (1 / (4πε<sub>0</sub>)) * ∫<sub>s'</sub> (ρ<sub>s</sub> / |r - r'|) ds'
        ```
    *   **For a volume charge source ρ<sub>v</sub> distributed over v':**

        ```html
        V = (1 / (4πε<sub>0</sub>)) * ∫<sub>v'</sub> (ρ<sub>v</sub> / |r - r'|) dv'
        ```

*   **Key Point:**  Similar to the electric field calculations, we integrate the contributions to the potential from infinitesimal charge elements.  `r'` points to the charge element, and `r` points to the observation point.  The potential is a scalar quantity, so the integration is generally simpler than the vector integration required for the electric field.

## Page 24: Electric Potential and Electric Field

This slide shows the relationship between electric potential (V) and electric field (E).

*   **Relationship:**  Voltage and electric field can each be calculated from the other.

*   **Integral Relationship (V from E):**

    ```html
    V = -∫<sub>A</sub><sup>B</sup> E ⋅ dl = +∫<sub>B</sub><sup>A</sup> E ⋅ dl
    ```

*   **Path Independence:** Since voltage is independent of path, the closed-loop line integral of the electric field is zero:

    ```html
    ∮ E ⋅ dl = 0
    ```

*   **Stokes' Theorem:** Applying Stokes' theorem, we can rewrite this as:

    ```html
    ∮ E ⋅ dl = ∫<sub>S</sub> (∇ × E) ⋅ dS = 0
    ```

*   **Curl of E:**  Since this holds for any arbitrary surface, the integrand must be zero:

    ```html
    ∇ × E = 0
    ```
    This shows that the electric field is *conservative* (its curl is zero).

*   **Gradient Relationship (E from V):**  Using the vector identity ∇ × (∇V) = 0, and the fact that ∇ × E = 0, we can express the electric field as the negative gradient of the potential:

    ```html
    E = -∇V
    ```

*   **Key Concept:** The electric field points in the direction of the *steepest decrease* in potential. The negative sign reflects this.  This is a fundamental relationship between the scalar potential and the vector electric field.

## Page 25: Electrostatic Energy

This slide begins the discussion of electrostatic energy, the energy stored in a system of charges.

*   **Concept:** The energy stored in a system of charges is equal to the work done to assemble those charges from infinity (where the potential is zero).
*   **Bringing in the First Charge (Q<sub>1</sub>):**  Bringing the first charge (Q<sub>1</sub>) into an empty region requires no work (W<sub>1</sub> = 0) because there is no pre-existing electric field.
*   **Bringing in the Second Charge (Q<sub>2</sub>):** Bringing in the second charge (Q<sub>2</sub>) *does* require work because it experiences the electric field (and therefore voltage) created by Q<sub>1</sub>.
    ```html
    W<sub>2</sub> = Q<sub>2</sub>V<sub>21</sub>
    ```
    *   **V<sub>21</sub>:**  The potential at the location of Q<sub>2</sub> due to Q<sub>1</sub>.

## Page 26: Electrostatic Energy (Continued)

This slide continues the calculation of electrostatic energy for a system of three charges.

*  **Bringing in the Third Charge (Q3):** Bringing in the third charge(Q3) will experience voltage from Q1 and voltage from Q2, which will combine by superposition.
*   **Work to bring in Q<sub>3</sub>:**

    ```html
    W<sub>3</sub> = Q<sub>3</sub>(V<sub>31</sub> + V<sub>32</sub>)
    ```
    *   **V<sub>31</sub>:** Potential at the location of Q<sub>3</sub> due to Q<sub>1</sub>.
    *   **V<sub>32</sub>:** Potential at the location of Q<sub>3</sub> due to Q<sub>2</sub>.

*   **Total Energy (W<sub>tot</sub>):**  The total energy stored in the system of three charges is the sum of the work done to bring in each charge:

    ```html
    W<sub>tot</sub> = W<sub>1</sub> + W<sub>2</sub> + W<sub>3</sub> = 0 + Q<sub>2</sub>V<sub>21</sub> + Q<sub>3</sub>(V<sub>31</sub> + V<sub>32</sub>) = Q<sub>2</sub>V<sub>21</sub> + Q<sub>3</sub>V<sub>31</sub> + Q<sub>3</sub>V<sub>32</sub>
    ```

## Page 27: Electrostatic Energy (Symmetrization)

This slide derives a more symmetrical expression for the electrostatic energy.

*  **Assembling in Reverse Order:** To simplify the calculations, assemble the charges in reverse order, obtaining:

    ```html
     W<sub>tot</sub> =  Q<sub>2</sub>V<sub>23</sub> + Q<sub>1</sub>V<sub>13</sub> + Q<sub>1</sub>V<sub>12</sub>
    ```
*   **Adding the Two Expressions:**  Adding the expressions for W<sub>tot</sub> from assembling the charges in the original order and the reverse order:

    ```html
    2W<sub>tot</sub> = Q<sub>2</sub>V<sub>23</sub> + Q<sub>1</sub>V<sub>13</sub> + Q<sub>1</sub>V<sub>12</sub> +  Q<sub>2</sub>V<sub>21</sub> + Q<sub>3</sub>V<sub>31</sub> + Q<sub>3</sub>V<sub>32</sub>
          = Q<sub>1</sub>(V<sub>12</sub> + V<sub>13</sub>) + Q<sub>2</sub>(V<sub>21</sub> + V<sub>23</sub>) + Q<sub>3</sub>(V<sub>31</sub> + V<sub>32</sub>)
    ```

*   **Key Insight:**  Each term in the final expression is the product of a charge (Q<sub>i</sub>) and the total potential (V<sub>i</sub>) at the location of that charge due to *all the other charges*.

## Page 28: Electrostatic Energy (Generalization)

This slide generalizes the electrostatic energy expression for N point charges.

*   **General Equation:**

    ```html
    W<sub>E</sub> = (1/2) Σ<sub>k=1</sub><sup>N</sup> Q<sub>k</sub>V<sub>k</sub>
    ```
    *   **W<sub>E</sub>:** Total electrostatic energy.
    *   **Q<sub>k</sub>:**  The k<sup>th</sup> charge.
    *   **V<sub>k</sub>:** The potential at the location of the k<sup>th</sup> charge due to *all other charges*.
    *   **(1/2):**  The factor of 1/2 accounts for the double-counting that occurs when we sum over all charges (each pair interaction is counted twice).

*   **Key Concept:** This is the general expression for the energy stored in a collection of N point charges.

## Page 29: Electrostatic Energy (Charge Densities)

This slide expresses the electrostatic energy in terms of charge densities.

*   **Concept:**  For continuous charge distributions, we replace the summation with integrals.

*   **Equations:**
    *   **For a line charge source ρ<sub>l</sub> distributed over l':**

        ```html
        W<sub>E</sub> = (1/2) ∫<sub>l'</sub> ρ<sub>l</sub>V dl'
        ```
    *   **For a surface charge source ρ<sub>s</sub> distributed over s':**

        ```html
        W<sub>E</sub> = (1/2) ∫<sub>s'</sub> ρ<sub>s</sub>V ds'
        ```
    *   **For a volume charge source ρ<sub>v</sub> distributed over v':**

        ```html
        W<sub>E</sub> = (1/2) ∫<sub>v'</sub> ρ<sub>v</sub>V dv'
        ```

*   **Key Idea:**  These equations are analogous to the point charge case, but we integrate the product of the charge density and the potential over the appropriate region.

## Page 30: Stored Potential Energy Field Expression

This slide expresses the electrostatic energy in terms of the electric field.

*   **Derivation:**  Starting with the volume charge density expression and using the differential form of Gauss's Law (ρ<sub>v</sub>
