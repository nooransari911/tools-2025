Okay, here's a comprehensive set of notes based on the provided Ansys Electromagnetics course PPT content, formatted primarily with Markdown and incorporating HTML where necessary for clarity:

# Ansys Electromagnetics: Vectors

## 1. Introduction and Sources

This material on vectors is drawn from the following sources:

*   **Elements of Electromagnetics**, by Matthew N.O. Sadiku, 5th ed. (2010)
*   **Engineering Electromagnetics**, by Nathan Ida, 3rd ed. (2015)
*   **Microwave Engineering**, by David M. Pozar, 4th ed. (2012)

## 2. What is a Vector?

A **vector** is a quantity that possesses both **magnitude** and **direction**.  This distinguishes it from a **scalar**, which has only magnitude.

**Examples of Vectors:**

*   **Displacement:** "The coffee shop is five miles *north* of here." (Magnitude: 5 miles, Direction: North)
*   **Velocity:** "The cars raced around the track *counterclockwise* at over 300 mph." (Magnitude: >300 mph, Direction: Counterclockwise)
*   **Radiation of light and heat:** "Light and heat radiate *outward* from the sun at 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> m/s."

**Examples of Scalars (contrasting the vector examples above):**

*   **Distance:** "To get to the coffee shop, you have to drive five miles." (Magnitude only)
*   **Speed:** "The racing cars reached speeds of over 300 mph." (Magnitude only)
* **Speed of Light in a vacuum:** "Light in a vacuum travels at a rate of 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s."

## 3. Vector Nomenclature

To maintain consistency, we will use the following conventions when discussing vectors:

*   **General Vector:** A general vector will be represented with a bar over the symbol. For example,  `Ā`.

*   **Magnitude of a Vector:** The magnitude (or length) of a vector `Ā` can be denoted in two ways:
    *   Using absolute value bars:  `|Ā|`
    *   Using the symbol without the bar: `A`

    It is crucial to understand that `A` (without the bar) represents a *scalar* quantity – the magnitude of the vector `Ā`.

*   **Unit Vectors:**  A unit vector has a magnitude of 1 and indicates direction.  Unit vectors are denoted with a "hat" (circumflex) symbol over them, along with a subscript to indicate the direction.
    *   The unit vector in the direction of vector `Ā` is written as: `â<sub>A</sub>`

## 4. Unit Vectors and Coordinate Systems

**Unit Vector Definition:**

A unit vector is any vector with a magnitude of exactly 1. It points in a specific direction but has no "length" beyond unity.

**Calculating a Unit Vector:**

The unit vector in the direction of a given vector `Ā` is found by dividing the vector by its magnitude:

```html
<p>â<sub>A</sub> = Ā / |Ā| = Ā / A</p>
```
Or, written in markdown code block.

```
â<sub>A</sub> = Ā / |Ā| = Ā / A
```

**Importance in Coordinate Systems:**

Unit vectors are essential for defining coordinate systems.  Since we typically deal with three-dimensional space, we describe spatial vectors as the sum of three linearly independent (mutually orthogonal, meaning at right angles to each other) components.

*   **Coordinate System:**  A system for describing locations in space.
*   **Basis Vectors:** The three unit vectors that define a particular coordinate system.  These vectors are mutually orthogonal.

## 5. The Cartesian Coordinate System

The Cartesian coordinate system is a fundamental and widely used system.

*   **Basis Vectors:**  `â<sub>x</sub>`, `â<sub>y</sub>`, and `â<sub>z</sub>`.  These represent unit vectors along the x, y, and z axes, respectively.
* **Coordinate Variables**: x, y, and z.

**Visual Representation:**
The z-axis is perpendicular to the plane formed by x and y axes.

*   x-axis: horizontal, usually left to right.
*   y-axis: horizontal, usually bottom to top.
*   z-axis: vertical, coming out of the page/screen.

A point `P` in the Cartesian coordinate system is defined by its x, y, and z coordinates.

**Expressing a General Vector:**

Any vector `Ā` in the Cartesian coordinate system can be expressed as a linear combination (a sum with scalar multipliers) of the basis vectors:

```html
<p>Ā = A<sub>x</sub>â<sub>x</sub> + A<sub>y</sub>â<sub>y</sub> + A<sub>z</sub>â<sub>z</sub></p>
```
Or, written in markdown code block:
```
Ā = A<sub>x</sub>â<sub>x</sub> + A<sub>y</sub>â<sub>y</sub> + A<sub>z</sub>â<sub>z</sub>
```
Where:

*   `A<sub>x</sub>`, `A<sub>y</sub>`, and `A<sub>z</sub>` are the *scalar* components of the vector `Ā` along the x, y, and z axes, respectively.  These are the magnitudes of the vector's projections onto each axis.

**Ranges of Coordinate Variables:**

The Cartesian coordinate variables can take on any real value:

*   -∞ ≤ x ≤ +∞
*   -∞ ≤ y ≤ +∞
*   -∞ ≤ z ≤ +∞

## 6. Vector Addition (Numerical)

Vector addition, subtraction, and multiplication are fundamental operations.  We'll focus on addition here.

**Numerical Vector Addition:**

Vector addition in Cartesian coordinates is performed component-wise.  This means you add the corresponding components of the vectors being added.

**Procedure:**

Given two vectors:

```
Ā = A<sub>x</sub>â<sub>x</sub> + A<sub>y</sub>â<sub>y</sub> + A<sub>z</sub>â<sub>z</sub>
B̄ = B<sub>x</sub>â<sub>x</sub> + B<sub>y</sub>â<sub>y</sub> + B<sub>z</sub>â<sub>z</sub>
```

Their sum, `Ā + B̄`, is calculated as:

```
Ā + B̄ = (A<sub>x</sub> + B<sub>x</sub>)â<sub>x</sub> + (A<sub>y</sub> + B<sub>y</sub>)â<sub>y</sub> + (A<sub>z</sub> + B<sub>z</sub>)â<sub>z</sub>
```

**Important Note:** This simple component-wise addition *only* works directly in the *Cartesian coordinate system*.  In other coordinate systems (cylindrical, spherical), you must be much more careful, as the basis vectors themselves can change direction depending on location. This will likely be covered later in the course.

# Magnetostatic Material Interaction

This course, developed by Kathryn L. Smith, PhD, covers the fundamental laws of magnetostatics in the context of materials, focusing on how magnetic fields interact with different materials. The source material comes from:

*   "Elements of Electromagnetics," by Matthew N.O Sadiku, 5th ed. (2010)
*   "Engineering Electromagnetics," by Nathan Ida, 3rd ed. (2015)
*   "Microwave Engineering," by David Pozar, 4th ed. (2012)

## Agenda

The course will cover the following key topics:

1.  **The Constitutive Relation:** Describing how materials respond to magnetic fields.
2.  **Boundary Conditions for the Magnetic Field:** How magnetic fields behave at the interface between different materials.
3.  **Inductance:**  The property of a circuit element to oppose changes in current.
4.  **Energy, Forces, and Torques:**  Calculating energy storage, forces, and torques in magnetic systems.
5.  **Faraday's Law and Lenz's Law:**  Relating changing magnetic fields to induced voltages.
6.  **Motional and Transformer EMF:**  Understanding the different types of electromotive force (EMF).

## 1. The Constitutive Relation

In free space, the magnetic field intensity (**H**) and the magnetic flux density (**B**) are related by the permeability of free space (μ<sub>0</sub>):

**B** = μ<sub>0</sub>**H**

However, real-world applications involve materials, not just free space.  Materials have their own magnetic properties due to the behavior of electrons within their atoms.

**Atomic Magnetization:**

*   Electrons orbiting and spinning within atoms create tiny magnetic dipole moments, denoted by **m**.
*   In a neutral, unbiased material, these atomic magnetic moments are randomly oriented.  The net effect is zero overall magnetization, and therefore no net magnetic field.
*   When an external magnetic field (**H**<sub>a</sub>) is applied, these atomic moments tend to align with the field. This alignment creates a *response field* (**H**<sub>r</sub>).  The degree of alignment depends on the material's properties.

**Relative Permeability (μ<sub>r</sub>):**

The material's response is quantified by its *relative permeability* (μ<sub>r</sub>).  This parameter describes how much more (or less) permeable the material is compared to free space. The constitutive relation for **B** in a material becomes:

**B** = μ<sub>0</sub>μ<sub>r</sub>**H** = μ**H**

where:

*   μ = μ<sub>0</sub>μ<sub>r</sub> is the *absolute permeability* of the material.

**Homogeneity:**

This relationship assumes the material is *homogeneous* on the scale of interest. This means the material's properties are uniform throughout, or at least appear uniform at the wavelength scale of the electromagnetic fields.

**Frequency Dependence:**

It's important to note that μ<sub>r</sub> can be frequency-dependent.  The equation **B** = μ<sub>0</sub>μ<sub>r</sub> * **H** uses an asterisk (*) to indicate convolution.  This acknowledges that the material's response might vary with the frequency of the applied magnetic field. For this introductory course, we will simplify and assume μ<sub>r</sub> is constant with respect to frequency, allowing us to use:

**B** = μ**H**

## 2. Boundary Conditions for the Magnetic Field

When a magnetic field crosses a boundary between two materials with different permeabilities (μ<sub>r1</sub> ≠ μ<sub>r2</sub>), a surface current density (**J**<sub>s</sub>) may be generated at the boundary.  To analyze this, we decompose the magnetic field into normal and tangential components.

**Tangential Components:**

Consider a small rectangular loop (contour *abcd*) spanning the boundary, with sides parallel and perpendicular to the interface.  Apply Ampere's Law:

∮<sub>*abcd*</sub> **H** ⋅ d**l** = I<sub>enclosed</sub>

As the height of the loop approaches zero, the contributions from the normal components of **H** become negligible.  The enclosed current is due to the surface current density, **J**<sub>s</sub>. This gives us:

H<sub>1t</sub>dl<sub>1</sub> - H<sub>2t</sub>dl<sub>2</sub> = J<sub>s</sub>dl

Where:

* H<sub>1t</sub> is the tangential component of magnetic field in the region 1
* H<sub>2t</sub> is the tangential component of magnetic field in the region 2
* dl is the infinitesimal length

Because the infinitesimal lengths `dl1` and `dl2` are equal, we have:
H<sub>1t</sub> - H<sub>2t</sub> = J<sub>s</sub>

This states that the *discontinuity* in the tangential component of **H** is equal to the surface current density.

**Normal Components:**

Consider a small cylindrical Gaussian surface (pillbox) spanning the boundary. Apply the principle of magnetic flux conservation (Solenoidal Law), which states that the net magnetic flux through a closed surface is zero:

∮<sub>S</sub> **B** ⋅ d**s** = 0

As the height of the cylinder approaches zero, the contributions from the tangential components of **B** become negligible.  This leaves only the normal components:

∫<sub>s1</sub> B<sub>1n</sub>dS<sub>1</sub> - ∫<sub>s2</sub> B<sub>2n</sub>dS<sub>2</sub> = 0

Because dS<sub>1</sub> = dS<sub>2</sub>:

B<sub>1n</sub> = B<sub>2n</sub>

This means the *normal component of **B** is continuous* across the boundary.

Using the constitutive relation (**B** = μ**H**), we can rewrite this in terms of **H**:

μ<sub>1</sub>H<sub>1n</sub> = μ<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>

**Summary of Boundary Conditions:**

*   **Tangential H:** H<sub>1t</sub> - H<sub>2t</sub> = J<sub>s</sub>
*   **Normal B:** B<sub>1n</sub> = B<sub>2n</sub>  (or μ<sub>1</sub>H<sub>1n</sub> = μ<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>)

## 3. Inductance

Inductance (L) is a measure of a circuit element's ability to store energy in a magnetic field.  It opposes changes in current.

**Self-Inductance (L<sub>11</sub>):**

Consider a loop C<sub>1</sub> carrying current I<sub>1</sub>. This current generates a magnetic flux density **B**<sub>1</sub>.  The total magnetic flux (Φ<sub>11</sub>) linking loop C<sub>1</sub> due to its own current is:

Φ<sub>11</sub> = ∫<sub>S1</sub> **B**<sub>1</sub> ⋅ d**s**<sub>1</sub>

where S<sub>1</sub> is the surface enclosed by loop C<sub>1</sub>.

The *self-inductance* (L<sub>11</sub>) of loop C<sub>1</sub> is defined as the ratio of the flux linkage to the current:

L<sub>11</sub> = Φ<sub>11</sub> / I<sub>1</sub>

**Mutual Inductance (L<sub>12</sub>):**

Now, bring a second loop C<sub>2</sub> into proximity with C<sub>1</sub>.  The magnetic flux density **B**<sub>1</sub> (created by I<sub>1</sub>) will also link loop C<sub>2</sub>, creating a flux linkage Φ<sub>12</sub>:

Φ<sub>12</sub> = ∫<sub>S2</sub> **B**<sub>1</sub> ⋅ d**s**<sub>2</sub>

The *mutual inductance* (L<sub>12</sub>) between loops C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> is:

L<sub>12</sub> = Φ<sub>12</sub> / I<sub>1</sub>

**Generalization (Multiple Turns):**

If loop C<sub>1</sub> has N<sub>1</sub> turns and loop C<sub>2</sub> has N<sub>2</sub> turns, the inductances become:

L<sub>11</sub> = N<sub>1</sub>Φ<sub>11</sub> / I<sub>1</sub>
L<sub>12</sub> = N<sub>2</sub>Φ<sub>12</sub> / I<sub>1</sub>

**Reciprocity:**

Mutual inductance is reciprocal, meaning:

L<sub>12</sub> = L<sub>21</sub> = (N<sub>2</sub>Φ<sub>12</sub> / I<sub>1</sub>) = (N<sub>1</sub>Φ<sub>21</sub> / I<sub>2</sub>)

**Self Inductance of Loop 2:**

Similarly, the self-inductance of loop C2 is:

L<sub>22</sub> = N<sub>2</sub>Φ<sub>22</sub> / I<sub>2</sub>

**Biot-Savart Law Implication:**

The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic flux density **B**<sub>1</sub> is directly proportional to the current I<sub>1</sub>.  This proportionality is crucial for defining inductance as a constant property of the geometry and materials.

## 4. Energy, Forces, and Torques

**Energy Stored in an Inductor:**

Consider a simple RL circuit. The voltage across the inductor is:

V<sub>L</sub> = L(dI/dt)

The instantaneous power stored in the inductor is:

P<sub>L</sub> = V<sub>L</sub>I = LI(dI/dt)

The total energy (W<sub>m</sub>) stored in the inductor is the time integral of power:

W<sub>m</sub> = ∫ P<sub>L</sub> dt = ∫ LI(dI/dt) dt = ∫ LI dI = (1/2)LI<sup>2</sup>

**Energy Stored in Multiple Inductors:**

For a system of *n* inductive elements, the total stored energy is:

W<sub>m</sub> = (1/2) Σ<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup> Σ<sub>j=1</sub><sup>n</sup> L<sub>ji</sub>I<sub>i</sub>I<sub>j</sub>

This accounts for both self-inductance and mutual inductance between the elements.

**Energy Density in a Magnetic Field:**

The stored energy can also be expressed in terms of the magnetic fields:

W<sub>m</sub> = (1/2) ∫<sub>V</sub> **B** ⋅ **H** dv

where *v* is the volume over which the fields are distributed.

**Forces and Torques (Lorentz Force Law):**

A moving electric charge (q) in a magnetic field (**B**) experiences a force:

**F**<sub>m</sub> = q**v** × **B**

where **v** is the velocity of the charge.

In terms of current (I), the force becomes:

**F**<sub>m</sub> = I**l** × **B**

where 1 is the length of the current.

**Torque on a Current Loop:**
Consider the case where the current loop can rotate around a central axis.

Consider a rectangular current loop in a uniform magnetic field. The forces on opposite sides of the loop create a *torque* (**T**).

*   **Side a-b:** Force out of the page (+y direction).
*   **Side b-c:** Zero force.
*   **Side c-d:** Force into the page (-y direction).
*   **Side d-a:** Zero force.

The magnitude of the torque is given by: T = 2Fd/2, where F is the force on either a-b or c-d, and d is the length of sides b-c and d-a.

If the loop is allowed to rotate around its central axis, we can use: T = *l*IBd cos φ. This uses the angle φ between the normal to the plane and the magnetic field.

The direction of the torque is determined by the right-hand rule. The general expression for the torque on a current loop is:

**T** = **m** × **B**

where **m** is the *magnetic dipole moment* of the loop:

**m** = I**A**n

Here:
    * **A** represents the area enclosed by the loop
    * I represents the current in the loop
    * *n* is the unit vector normal to the loop, determined by the right-hand rule (curl fingers in the direction of current, thumb points in the direction of *n*).

## 5. Faraday's Law and Lenz's Law

**Faraday's Law:**

A time-varying magnetic flux through a conductive loop induces a voltage (electromotive force, EMF) around the loop:

V<sub>ind</sub> = -dΦ/dt = -d/dt ∫<sub>S</sub> **B** ⋅ d**s**

where Φ is the magnetic flux through the surface S enclosed by the loop.

**Lenz's Law:**

The induced voltage creates a current that produces a magnetic flux *opposing* the change in the original flux.  This is the meaning of the negative sign in Faraday's Law.

Expressing voltage in terms of the electric field (V = ∮ **E** ⋅ d**l**), we get Lenz's Law:

∮<sub>C</sub> **E** ⋅ d**l** = -d/dt ∫<sub>S</sub> **B** ⋅ d**s** = -dΦ/dt

## 6. Motional and Transformer EMF

There are two ways to induce an EMF:

1.  **Transformer EMF:**  A *time-varying* magnetic field (**B**(t)) induces an EMF even if the loop is stationary:

    emf = -d/dt ∫<sub>S</sub> **B** ⋅ d**s**

    This is called "induced" or "transformer" EMF.

2.  **Motional EMF:**  A *stationary* magnetic field can induce an EMF if the conductive loop *moves* through it. This is due to the Lorentz force on the moving charges within the conductor:

    emf<sub>motional</sub> = ∮<sub>C</sub> (**v** × **B**) ⋅ d**l**

    where **v** is the velocity of the conductor.

**Total EMF:**

The total EMF is the sum of the motional and transformer EMFs:

emf<sub>total</sub> = -∫<sub>S</sub> (d**B**/dt) ⋅ d**s** + ∮<sub>C</sub> (**v** × **B**) ⋅ d**l**

Okay, here are detailed notes from the provided Ansys Electromagnetics course slides, covering "Electrostatic Material Interaction", formatted with Markdown and including embedded HTML where necessary for clarity and equation formatting:

# Electrostatic Material Interaction

These notes are based on a presentation developed by Kathryn L. Smith, PhD, for Ansys.  They cover the interaction of electrostatic fields with materials, building upon fundamental electrostatic principles.

## Sources

The material presented in this course is based on the following sources:

*   "Elements of Electromagnetics," by Matthew N.O. Sadiku, 5th ed. (2010)
*   "Engineering Electromagnetics," by Nathan Ida, 3rd ed. (2015)
*   "Microwave Engineering," by David Pozar, 4th ed. (2012)

## Agenda

This course extends the principles of electrostatics from free space to scenarios involving materials.  While in free space the electric field (**E**) and electric flux density (**D**) are related by the simple equation:

**D** = ε₀**E**

where ε₀ is the permittivity of free space, real-world engineering applications almost always involve materials like dielectrics and conductors.  This necessitates understanding how electric fields interact with these materials.  The course will cover the following topics:

1.  **The Constitutive Relation and Boundary Conditions:**  How materials affect the relationship between **E** and **D**, and what happens at the interface between different materials.
2.  **Updating the Free-Space Equations:**  Modifying the equations derived for free space to account for the presence of materials.
3.  **Capacitance:**  Defining and calculating capacitance in the context of material-filled systems.

## Boundary Conditions for the Electric Field

A crucial aspect of understanding electrostatic material interaction is analyzing what happens at the boundary between two different materials.  Consider two regions, Region 1 and Region 2, with different relative permittivities (ε<sub>r1</sub> and ε<sub>r2</sub>, respectively). Assume that ε<sub>r1</sub> ≠ ε<sub>r2</sub>. Let **E**<sub>1</sub> be the electric field in Region 1 approaching the boundary, and **E**<sub>2</sub> be the electric field in Region 2 after the interaction.

To analyze this, we decompose the electric field vectors into components:

*   **Tangential Component (E<sub>t</sub>):** The component of the electric field parallel to the boundary surface.
*   **Normal Component (E<sub>n</sub>):** The component of the electric field perpendicular to the boundary surface.

So, **E**<sub>1</sub> = **E**<sub>1t</sub> + **E**<sub>1n</sub>, and **E**<sub>2</sub> = **E**<sub>2t</sub> + **E**<sub>2n</sub>.

### Deriving the Tangential Boundary Condition (Faraday's Law)

We use a rectangular loop (abcd) that straddles the boundary, with half the loop in Region 1 and half in Region 2. The loop's normal is in the z direction, pointing out of the slide. The loop has infinitesimal height.

Applying Faraday's Law around this closed loop:

∮<sub>abcd</sub> **E** ⋅ d**l** = -d/dt ∫<sub>S</sub> **B** ⋅ d**s**

Where:

*   ∮<sub>abcd</sub> is the line integral around the closed loop abcd.
*   **E** is the electric field.
*   d**l** is an infinitesimal displacement vector along the loop.
*   d/dt is the time derivative.
*   ∫<sub>S</sub> is the surface integral over the area enclosed by the loop.
*   **B** is the magnetic flux density.
*    d**s** is an infinitesimal surface area vector, normal to the surface.

As the height of the loop approaches zero, the following happens:

1.  The contributions of the normal components of the electric field (**E**<sub>1n</sub> and **E**<sub>2n</sub>) to the line integral become negligible.
2.  The area enclosed by the loop (S) approaches zero, and therefore the magnetic flux through the loop (∫<sub>S</sub> **B** ⋅ d**s**) also approaches zero.

Because the area of the loop is heading to zero, the time derivative of the flux goes to zero. This simplifies Faraday's law, and the line integral reduces to the contributions from the tangential components:

E<sub>1t</sub> * d - E<sub>2t</sub> * d = 0

Where `d` is the width of the loop. This simplifies to:

E<sub>1t</sub> = E<sub>2t</sub>

**Conclusion (Tangential Boundary Condition):** The tangential component of the electric field is continuous across a boundary between two different materials.

### Deriving the Normal Boundary Condition (Gauss's Law)

Now, consider a small cylindrical Gaussian surface that straddles the boundary.  Half of the cylinder is in Region 1, and the other half is in Region 2. The top and bottom surfaces of the cylinder are parallel to the boundary.

Applying Gauss's Law to this closed surface:

∮<sub>S</sub> **D** ⋅ d**s** = ∫<sub>V</sub> ρ<sub>v</sub> dv = Q<sub>encl</sub>

Where:

*   ∮<sub>S</sub> is the surface integral over the closed cylindrical surface.
*   **D** is the electric flux density.
*   d**s** is an infinitesimal surface area vector.
*   ∫<sub>V</sub> is the volume integral over the volume enclosed by the cylinder.
*   ρ<sub>v</sub> is the volume charge density.
*   Q<sub>encl</sub> is the total enclosed charge.

Let the height of the cylinder approach zero. The following happens:

1.  The contributions from the side of the cylinder (the tangential components) become negligible because the area goes to zero.
2.  The enclosed charge (Q<sub>encl</sub>) becomes the surface charge density (ρ<sub>s</sub>) multiplied by the area (A) of the top/bottom of the cylinder: Q<sub>encl</sub> = ρ<sub>s</sub> * A.
3.  The surface integral simplifies to the contributions from the normal components of **D**:

D<sub>1n</sub> * A - D<sub>2n</sub> * A = ρ<sub>s</sub> * A

Dividing by A, we get:

D<sub>1n</sub> - D<sub>2n</sub> = ρ<sub>s</sub>

Using the constitutive relation **D** = ε**E**, where ε = ε<sub>0</sub>ε<sub>r</sub>, we can rewrite this as:

ε<sub>1</sub>E<sub>1n</sub> - ε<sub>2</sub>E<sub>2n</sub> = ρ<sub>s</sub>

**Conclusion (Normal Boundary Condition):** The difference in the normal components of the electric flux density across a boundary is equal to the surface charge density at that boundary.  If there's no surface charge (ρ<sub>s</sub> = 0), then the normal component of **D** is continuous.

### Summary of Boundary Conditions

*   **Tangential Electric Field:** E<sub>1t</sub> = E<sub>2t</sub>
*   **Normal Electric Flux Density:** D<sub>1n</sub> - D<sub>2n</sub> = ρ<sub>s</sub>  , or  ε<sub>1</sub>E<sub>1n</sub> - ε<sub>2</sub>E<sub>2n</sub> = ρ<sub>s</sub>

## Updating Free-Space Equations

The equations derived for electrostatics in free space remain valid in materials, but with a crucial modification: we must replace the permittivity of free space (ε<sub>0</sub>) with the permittivity of the material (ε = ε<sub>0</sub>ε<sub>r</sub>) wherever it appears.  ε<sub>r</sub> is the relative permittivity (or dielectric constant) of the material.

**Examples:**

*   **Force between two charges:**  In free space, the force between two point charges Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub> separated by a distance R is:

    F = (Q<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>2</sub>) / (4πε<sub>0</sub>R<sup>2</sup>)  **a**<sub>R</sub>

    In a material with relative permittivity ε<sub>r</sub>, the force becomes:

    F = (Q<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>2</sub>) / (4πε<sub>0</sub>ε<sub>r</sub>R<sup>2</sup>)  **a**<sub>R</sub>

*   **Voltage due to a point charge:**  In free space, the voltage at a distance r<sub>1</sub> from a point charge Q<sub>1</sub> is:

    V = Q<sub>1</sub> / (4πε<sub>0</sub>r<sub>1</sub>)

    In a material with relative permittivity ε<sub>r</sub>, the voltage becomes:

    V = Q<sub>1</sub> / (4πε<sub>0</sub>ε<sub>r</sub>r<sub>1</sub>)

*   **Electrostatic Energy Density:** In free space, the electrostatic energy density is:

    w<sub>E</sub> = (1/2)ε<sub>0</sub>E<sup>2</sup>

    In a material with relative permittivity ε<sub>r</sub>, the energy density becomes:

    w<sub>E</sub> = (1/2)ε<sub>0</sub>ε<sub>r</sub>E<sup>2</sup> = (1/2)εE<sup>2</sup> = (1/2)**D**⋅**E**

    Notice that the presence of a dielectric material *increases* the stored energy density for a given electric field strength.

## Capacitance

Capacitance (C) is a measure of a system's ability to store electric charge. It is defined as the ratio of the charge (Q) stored on the conductors to the voltage (V) between them:

C = Q / V

Capacitance is measured in Farads (F).

### Calculating Capacitance: General Procedure

Any arrangement of conductors possesses capacitance. Here's a general procedure to calculate it:

1.  **Assume Charges:**  Place a positive test charge +Q on one conductor and, if there's a second conductor, a negative test charge -Q on the other.  If there is only *one* conductor, assume the other "conductor" is at infinity.
2.  **Calculate Electric Field (E):** Determine the electric field (**E**) resulting from these test charges.  This may involve using Gauss's Law or other techniques.
3.  **Calculate Voltage (V):** Integrate the electric field along a path from the negative conductor to the positive conductor (or from infinity to the single conductor) to find the voltage difference:

    V = -∫ **E** ⋅ d**l**

    (The path of integration should go from the negative charge/potential to positive)
4.  **Calculate Capacitance:** Divide the magnitude of the charge (Q) by the voltage (V) to obtain the capacitance: C = Q/V.

**Alternative Procedure (Using Voltage):**

1. **Assume Voltage:** Apply a test voltage V between the conductors. If it's single conductor problem, then assume V is a potential relative to ground.
2. **Calculate Electric Field:** Find the electric field (E) resulting from the applied voltage, often using **E** = -∇V.
3. **Calculate Charge:** Calculate the charge Q on one of the conductors based on the electric field and Gauss's Law.
4. **Calculate Capacitance** Divide the calculated charge Q by the assumed voltage to find the capacitance.

### Example: Parallel Plate Capacitor

Consider a parallel plate capacitor with two identical conductive plates of area A = wl, separated by a distance d. The space between the plates is filled with a dielectric material of permittivity ε = ε<sub>0</sub>ε<sub>r</sub>.  Assume minimal fringing fields (i.e., the electric field is uniform between the plates and zero outside).

**Method 1 (Assume Charges):**

1.  **Assume Charges:** Place +Q on the top plate and -Q on the bottom plate.
2.  **Calculate Electric Field (E):** Apply Gauss's Law using a Gaussian surface enclosing the top plate. The electric field will be uniform and directed from the positive to the negative plate:

    ∮ **D** ⋅ d**s** = Q<sub>encl</sub>
    εE * A = Q
    E = Q / (εA) = Q/(ε<sub>0</sub>ε<sub>r</sub>wl)  , in the -**a**<sub>z</sub> direction (assuming z-axis is perpendicular to the plates)

3.  **Calculate Voltage (V):** Integrate the electric field from the bottom plate to the top plate:

    V = -∫<sub>bottom</sub><sup>top</sup> **E** ⋅ d**l** = -∫<sub>0</sub><sup>d</sup> (-Q/(ε<sub>0</sub>ε<sub>r</sub>wl)) dz = Qd / (ε<sub>0</sub>ε<sub>r</sub>wl)

4.  **Calculate Capacitance:** C = Q/V = (ε<sub>0</sub>ε<sub>r</sub>wl) / d = εA/d

**Method 2 (Assume Voltage):**
1. **Assume voltage:** Assume a voltage of V is placed across the two plates.
2. **Calculate Electric Field (E):** Assuming no fringing field, the electric field is **E** = -∇V. With the voltage differential across a distance d, the magnitude of the electric field will be E = V/d, and the direction is -**a**<sub>z</sub>.
3. **Calculate the charge, Q:** Using Gauss' Law, the charge on the top plate is:
   Q<sub>encl</sub> = +Q = ε ∮ **E** ⋅ d**s**.
    Substituting **E** and performing the surface integral we have:
     Q = ε (V/d) * wl
4. **Calculate Capacitance** Dividing the calculated charge by the applied voltage, we have:
C = Q/V = (ε<sub>0</sub>ε<sub>r</sub>wl) / d = εA/d

**Result:** The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is C = εA/d = (ε<sub>0</sub>ε<sub>r</sub>A) / d.  It's directly proportional to the area of the plates and the permittivity of the dielectric, and inversely proportional to the separation distance.

### Energy Stored in a Capacitor

The energy stored in a system of charges can be calculated as

W<sub>E</sub> = (1/2) Σ<sub>k=1</sub><sup>N</sup> Q<sub>k</sub>V<sub>k</sub>

Using the definition C = Q/V, this can also be shown to equal, for a single capacitor, the familiar:

W = (1/2)CV<sup>2</sup> = (1/2)QV = Q<sup>2</sup>/(2C)

This represents the energy stored in the electric field within the capacitor.

Okay, here's a comprehensive set of notes derived from the provided Ansys Electromagnetics course PPT slides, formatted using Markdown and incorporating HTML where necessary for clarity and presentation:

# Electrostatics in Free Space - Ansys Innovation Course

These notes cover the fundamentals of electrostatics, focusing on behavior in free space. They are based on the Ansys Innovation Course and draw upon established electromagnetics textbooks.

## Sources

The material presented in this course is based on the following sources:

*   **"Elements of Electromagnetics"** by Matthew N.O. Sadiku, 5th ed. (2010)
*   **"Engineering Electromagnetics"** by Nathan Ida, 3rd ed. (2015)
*   **"Microwave Engineering"** by David Pozar, 4th ed. (2012)

## Introduction to Electric Fields

Before diving into the mechanics of electric fields, we need to define some fundamental terms and concepts.

### Electromagnetic Constants

*   **ε₀ (Electric Permittivity of Free Space):**  8.854 x 10<sup>-12</sup> Farads per meter (F/m).  This constant represents the capability of a vacuum to permit electric fields.
*   **c (Speed of Light in a Vacuum):** 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> meters per second (m/s).
*   **e (Charge of an Electron):** -1.6019 x 10<sup>-19</sup> Coulombs (C).  This is the fundamental unit of electric charge.

### Fundamental Electric Fields

*   **E (Electric Field):**  A vector field representing the force per unit charge. Units are volts per meter (V/m).  It describes the force that a positive test charge would experience at a given point.
*   **D (Electric Flux Density):** A vector field related to the electric field and representing the amount of electric flux per unit area. Units are Coulombs per meter squared (C/m<sup>2</sup>).

    For this course (and in a vacuum), the relationship between **D** and **E** is simplified:

    ```html
    <b>D</b> = ε<sub>0</sub><b>E</b>
    ```
* **Fundamental Field Sources**
    *   **Q (Electric Charge):**  The source of electric fields. Units are Coulombs (C).
    *   **J (Electric Current Density):**  The flow of electric charge. Units are Amperes per meter squared (A/m<sup>2</sup>).  (This will be more relevant in later magnetostatics discussions.)

### Electric Field Visualization

An electric field, **E**, is a vector field.  This means that at every point in space, there's a vector indicating the direction and magnitude of the force that would be exerted on a positive test charge placed at that point.

*   **Positive Charge:**  The electric field lines point *radially outward* from a positive charge.
*   **Negative Charge:** The electric field lines point *radially inward* toward a negative charge.
* **Force on a Charge in an Electric Field:** An electron (negative charge) placed in the electric field of a positive charge will experience an *attractive force* towards the positive charge. This force is in the opposite direction of the electric field vector at the electron's location.

The same concept can be applied to a gravitational field, which exerts a force on a mass. For example, a rocket experiences a downward force because of the gravitational field around the earth.

## Charge

*   **Definition:** Charge is a fundamental property of matter.  It is the source of electric fields.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Positive Charge (+Q):** Creates an outward-pointing electric field.
    *   **Negative Charge (-Q):** Creates an inward-pointing electric field.
* **Visualizing electric fields:** Electric fields around positive and negative charges can be represented visually by vectors. The density and direction of these vectors will indicate the relative strength and direction of the field at each point.

## Coulomb's Law: Force

Coulomb's Law quantifies the electrostatic force between two *point charges*.

*   **Statement:** The force between two point charges is:
    1.  *Directly proportional* to the product of the magnitudes of the charges.
    2.  *Inversely proportional* to the square of the distance between them.
    3.  Directed along the line connecting the two charges.

*   **Equation:**

    ```html
    <b>F</b><sub>1</sub> = -<b>F</b><sub>2</sub> = (Q<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>2</sub> / 4πε<sub>0</sub>R<sup>2</sup>) <b>â</b><sub>R12</sub>
    ```

    Where:

    *   **F<sub>1</sub>:** Force experienced by charge 1 (Newtons, N).
    *   **F<sub>2</sub>:** Force experienced by charge 2 (Newtons, N).  Note that **F<sub>1</sub>** = -**F<sub>2</sub>** (Newton's Third Law).
    *   **Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>2</sub>:** Magnitudes of the charges (Coulombs, C).
    *   **ε₀:** Permittivity of free space (8.854 x 10<sup>-12</sup> F/m).
    *   **R:** Distance between the charges (meters, m).
    *   **â<sub>R12</sub>:** Unit vector pointing *from charge 1 to charge 2*.

*   **Vector Form (using position vectors):**

    If **r<sub>1</sub>** is the position vector of Q<sub>1</sub> and **r<sub>2</sub>** is the position vector of Q<sub>2</sub>, then:

    ```html
    R = |<b>r</b><sub>2</sub> - <b>r</b><sub>1</sub>|
    <br>
    <b>â</b><sub>R12</sub> = (<b>r</b><sub>2</sub> - <b>r</b><sub>1</sub>) / |<b>r</b><sub>2</sub> - <b>r</b><sub>1</sub>|
    ```
* **Attractive vs. Repulsive Force**
    * Charges with the *same sign* (both positive or both negative) experience a *repulsive* force.
    * Charges with *opposite signs* (one positive, one negative) experience an *attractive* force.

## Coulomb's Law: Electric Field

We can also use Coulomb's Law to determine the electric field created by a point charge.

*   **Definition of Electric Field:** The electric field (**E**) at a point is the force per unit charge that a *positive test charge* would experience at that point.

*   **Equation (from force):**

    ```html
    <b>E</b> = <b>F</b> / Q
    ```

    Where:

    * **E:** Electric Field
    *   **F:** Force on a test charge Q.
    *   **Q:** Magnitude of the test charge.

*   **Electric Field due to a Point Charge (at the origin):**

    If a point charge Q is located at the origin, the electric field at a point P (distance R from the origin) is:

    ```html
      <b>E</b> = (Q / 4πε<sub>0</sub>R<sup>2</sup>) <b>â</b><sub>R</sub>
    ```

    Where **â<sub>R</sub>** is the unit vector pointing from the origin to point P.

*   **Electric Field due to a Point Charge (not at the origin):**
    If the point charge Q is at position r', then:

    ```html
    <b>E</b> = (1 / 4πε<sub>0</sub>) * [Q(<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>) / |<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>|<sup>3</sup>]
    ```

    Where:

    *   **r:** Position vector of the observation point P.
    *   **r':** Position vector of the charge Q.
    * r - r' is the vector pointing from the charge to the point of observation.

## Superposition

The principle of superposition states that the total electric field at a point due to multiple charges is the *vector sum* of the electric fields due to each individual charge.

*   **Equation:**

    ```html
    <b>E</b><sub>total</sub> = <b>E</b><sub>Q1</sub> + <b>E</b><sub>Q2</sub> + <b>E</b><sub>Q3</sub> + ...
    ```
Or, in general:
    ```html
    <b>E</b><sub>total</sub> = Σ <b>E</b><sub>Qi</sub>
    ```

    Where:

    *   **E<sub>total</sub>:**  The total electric field at the point of interest.
    *   **E<sub>Qi</sub>:**  The electric field due to the i-th charge.

## Charge Density

Instead of dealing with discrete point charges, we often work with continuous charge distributions.  Charge density describes how charge is distributed over a region.

*   **Types of Charge Density:**

    *   **Line Charge Density (ρ<sub>l</sub>):** Charge per unit length (C/m).  Used for charges distributed along a line (e.g., a wire).
        ```html
        Q<sub>tot</sub> = ∫<sub>l'</sub> ρ<sub>l</sub> dl'
        ```
    *   **Surface Charge Density (ρ<sub>s</sub>):** Charge per unit area (C/m<sup>2</sup>). Used for charges distributed over a surface (e.g., a plate).
        ```html
        Q<sub>tot</sub> = ∫<sub>s'</sub> ρ<sub>s</sub> ds'
        ```
    *   **Volume Charge Density (ρ<sub>v</sub>):** Charge per unit volume (C/m<sup>3</sup>).  Used for charges distributed throughout a volume (e.g., a sphere).
        ```html
        Q<sub>tot</sub> = ∫<sub>v'</sub> ρ<sub>v</sub> dv'
        ```

    Where:

    *   *l'* represents a line.
    *   *s'* represents a surface.
    *   *v'* represents a volume.
    *   *dl'*, *ds'*, and *dv'* are infinitesimal elements of length, area, and volume, respectively.

## Coulomb's Law: Charge Density (General Form)

We can express the electric field due to continuous charge distributions using integrals:

*   **For a collection of N point charge sources Q<sub>n</sub>:**

    ```html
    <b>E</b> = (1 / 4πε<sub>0</sub>) Σ<sub>n=1</sub><sup>N</sup> [Q<sub>n</sub>(<b>r</b> - <b>r'<sub>n</sub></b>) / |<b>r</b> - <b>r'<sub>n</sub></b>|<sup>3</sup>]
    ```

*   **For a Line Charge (ρ<sub>l</sub>):**

    ```html
    <b>E</b> = (1 / 4πε<sub>0</sub>) ∫<sub>l'</sub> [ρ<sub>l</sub>(<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>) / |<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>|<sup>3</sup>] dl'
    ```

*   **For a Surface Charge (ρ<sub>s</sub>):**

    ```html
    <b>E</b> = (1 / 4πε<sub>0</sub>) ∫<sub>s'</sub> [ρ<sub>s</sub>(<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>) / |<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>|<sup>3</sup>] ds'
    ```

*   **For a Volume Charge (ρ<sub>v</sub>):**

    ```html
    <b>E</b> = (1 / 4πε<sub>0</sub>) ∫<sub>v'</sub> [ρ<sub>v</sub>(<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>) / |<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>|<sup>3</sup>] dv'
    ```

    **Important Note:** In all these cases, **r'** points to the location of the *source* (the charge element dl', ds', or dv'), and **r** points to the *observation point* where we are calculating the electric field.

## Electric Flux Density (D)

*   **Definition:**  **D** is a vector field related to the electric field **E** by the material properties of the medium.  It represents the electric flux per unit area.
* **Relationship to E (General Case):**
    The precise relationship between **D** and **E** can be complex, involving convolution in the time domain, because materials don't respond instantaneously to changes in the electric field.
* **Relationship to E (Simplified for this course - Vacuum):**
    For this introductory course and specifically for a vacuum, we use the simplified linear relationship:

    ```html
    <b>D</b> = ε<sub>0</sub><b>E</b>
    ```

## Gauss's Law

Gauss's Law provides a powerful way to relate the electric flux through a closed surface to the enclosed charge.

*   **Statement:** The total electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the total electric charge enclosed by that surface.

*   **Integral Form:**

    ```html
    Q<sub>encl</sub> = ∮<sub>S</sub> <b>D</b> ⋅ d<b>S</b>
    ```

    Where:

    *   **Q<sub>encl</sub>:**  The total charge enclosed by the surface S.
    *   **∮<sub>S</sub>:**  Indicates a surface integral over the closed surface S.
    *   **D:**  Electric flux density.
    *   **dS:**  An infinitesimal vector element of area, pointing outward normal to the surface.

* **Visualizing Gauss's Law:** Imagine a positive point charge. The electric field lines radiate outwards. If you draw a closed surface (e.g., a sphere) around the charge, Gauss's Law states that the total "outward flow" of the electric field (represented by the flux) is directly proportional to the enclosed charge.

*   **Gauss's Law with Charge Distributions:**

    We can combine Gauss's Law with the different charge density definitions:

    *   **Line Charge:**  `Q<sub>encl</sub> = ∮<sub>S</sub> <b>D</b> ⋅ d<b>S</b> = ∫<sub>l'</sub> ρ<sub>l</sub> dl'`
    *   **Surface Charge:** `Q<sub>encl</sub> = ∮<sub>S</sub> <b>D</b> ⋅ d<b>S</b> = ∫<sub>s'</sub> ρ<sub>s</sub> ds'`
    *   **Volume Charge:** `Q<sub>encl</sub> = ∮<sub>S</sub> <b>D</b> ⋅ d<b>S</b> = ∫<sub>v'</sub> ρ<sub>v</sub> dv'`

*   **Differential Form (using the Divergence Theorem):**

    The Divergence Theorem relates a surface integral to a volume integral:

    ```html
    ∮<sub>S</sub> <b>A</b> ⋅ d<b>S</b> = ∫<sub>V</sub> (∇ ⋅ <b>A</b>) dv
    ```

    Applying the Divergence Theorem to Gauss's Law:

    ```html
    Q<sub>encl</sub> = ∮<sub>S</sub> <b>D</b> ⋅ d<b>S</b> = ∫<sub>v'</sub> ρ<sub>v</sub> dv'  = ∫<sub>v'</sub> (∇ ⋅ <b>D</b>) dv'
    ```
    This holds true when:
    ```html
      ρ<sub>v</sub> = ∇ ⋅ <b>D</b>
    ```

    This is the *differential form* of Gauss's Law.  It states that the divergence of the electric flux density at a point is equal to the volume charge density at that point.

## Electric Work

*   **Definition:** Work is required to move a charged particle within an electric field.  This is because the electric field exerts a force on the charge.

*   **Work Equation:**

    ```html
    W = -∫<sub>A</sub><sup>B</sup> <b>F</b> ⋅ d<b>l</b>
    ```

    Where:

    *   **W:** Work done (Joules, J).
    *   **F:** Force on the charge (Newtons, N).
    *   **dl:**  Infinitesimal displacement vector along the path of motion.
    *   **A, B:**  Starting and ending points of the path.

*   **Sign Convention:**

    *   **Negative Work:** Work is *negative* if the force due to the electric field does the work (the charge moves in the direction it "wants" to go).
    *   **Positive Work:** Work is *positive* if an *external force* does the work against the electric field (we "push" the charge against its natural tendency).

* **Work and Potential Energy:** The work done in moving a charge within an electric field represents a change in the *potential energy* of the system.

## Electric Potential (Voltage)

*   **Definition:** Electric potential (V), often called voltage, is the *potential energy per unit charge*. It represents the work done per unit charge to move a charge from a reference point to a specific location in an electric field.

*   **Equation:**

    ```html
    V<sub>AB</sub> = W/Q = -(1/Q) ∫<sub>A</sub><sup>B</sup> <b>F</b> ⋅ d<b>l</b>
    ```

    Where:

    *   **V<sub>AB</sub>:**  The potential difference between points B and A.
    *   **W:** Work done to move charge Q from A to B.

*   **Relationship to Electric Field:**

    Since **F** = Q**E**, we can rewrite the potential difference as:

    ```html
    V<sub>AB</sub> = -∫<sub>A</sub><sup>B</sup> <b>E</b> ⋅ d<b>l</b>
    ```

*   **Path Independence:**  A crucial property of electrostatic fields is that the electric potential difference between two points is *independent of the path* taken.  This is a consequence of the electric field being *conservative*.  Mathematically, this means:

    ```html
    ∮ <b>E</b> ⋅ d<b>l</b> = 0
    ```
    (The line integral of the electric field around any closed loop is zero.)

* **Common Reference Point: Infinity**

    Often, the reference point for electric potential is taken to be *infinity*.  This means we define the potential at infinity to be zero.  The potential at a point is then the work done per unit charge to bring a charge from infinity to that point.

    For a point charge Q at the origin using infinity as a reference:

     ```html
      V<sub>AB</sub> =  -∫<sub>∞</sub><sup>r<sub>1</sub></sup> <b>E</b> ⋅ d<b>r</b> = Q<sub>1</sub> / (4πε<sub>0</sub>r<sub>1</sub>) = V<sub>B</sub>
      ```

    Where r<sub>1</sub> is the distance between point B and Q<sub>1</sub>.

## Electric Potential: Charge Density

*   **Point Charge:**
    ```html
    V = (1 / 4πε<sub>0</sub>) * (Q / |<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>|)
    ```

*   **Line Charge:**
    ```html
    V = (1 / 4πε<sub>0</sub>) ∫<sub>l'</sub> [ρ<sub>l</sub> / |<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>|] dl'
    ```

*   **Surface Charge:**
    ```html
    V = (1 / 4πε<sub>0</sub>) ∫<sub>s'</sub> [ρ<sub>s</sub> / |<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>|] ds'
    ```

*   **Volume Charge:**
    ```html
    V = (1 / 4πε<sub>0</sub>) ∫<sub>v'</sub> [ρ<sub>v</sub> / |<b>r</b> - <b>r'</b>|] dv'
    ```
    *In every case, <b>r'</b> points to the location of the source and <b>r</b> to the location of the observation point.

## Electric Potential and Electric Field (Relationship)

*  **Calculating Voltage from the Electric Field:** We've already seen:
    ```html
       V = -∫<sub>A</sub><sup>B</sup> <b>E</b> ⋅ d<b>l</b> = +∫<sub>B</sub><sup>A</sup> <b>E</b> ⋅ d<b>l</b>
       ```

*  **Calculating Electric Field from Voltage:** We can derive the electric field from the potential using the gradient:
    Because voltage is independent of path:
    ```html
    ∮ <b>E</b> ⋅ d<b>l</b> = 0
    ```
    Applying Stokes' theorem:
    ```html
        ∮ <b>E</b> ⋅ d<b>l</b> = ∫<sub>S</sub> ∇ × <b>E</b> = 0
    ```
    So that:

    ```html
    ∇ × <b>E</b> = 0
    ```

    Using the vector identity ∇ × ∇V = 0:

    ```html
    <b>E</b> = -∇V
    ```

    This equation states that the electric field is the *negative gradient* of the electric potential.  The electric field points in the direction of the *steepest decrease* in potential.

## Electrostatic Energy

*   **Definition:**  The electrostatic energy stored in a system of charges is the total work required to assemble the charges from an initial state where they are infinitely far apart (and thus have zero potential energy).

*   **Assembling Charges:**

    1.  **First Charge (Q<sub>1</sub>):**  Bringing the first charge (Q<sub>1</sub>) into a region with no pre-existing field requires *no work* (W<sub>1</sub> = 0).

    2.  **Second Charge (Q<sub>2</sub>):** Bringing the second charge (Q<sub>2</sub>) into the field created by Q<sub>1</sub> *does* require work.  The work done is  W<sub>2</sub> = Q<sub>2</sub>V<sub>21</sub>, where V<sub>21</sub> is the potential at the location of Q<sub>2</sub> due to Q<sub>1</sub>.

    3.  **Third Charge (Q<sub>3</sub>) and Beyond:**  Bringing in subsequent charges requires work against the fields created by *all* the previously assembled charges. For example, W<sub>3</sub> = Q<sub>3</sub>(V<sub>31</sub> + V<sub>32</sub>).

*   **Total Energy (for three charges):**

    The total electrostatic energy for three charges can be expressed as:

    ```html
    W<sub>tot</sub> = W<sub>1</sub> + W<sub>2</sub> + W<sub>3</sub> = 0 + Q<sub>2</sub>V<sub>21</sub> + Q<sub>3</sub>(V<sub>31</sub> + V<sub>32</sub>) = Q<sub>2</sub>V<sub>21</sub> + Q<sub>3</sub>V<sub>31</sub> + Q<sub>3</sub>V<sub>32</sub>
    ```

    Alternatively, if the charges are brought in a different order:

    ```html
     W<sub>tot</sub> = Q<sub>2</sub>V<sub>23</sub> + Q<sub>1</sub>V<sub>13</sub> + Q<sub>1</sub>V<sub>12</sub>
    ```
Adding these two expressions together:

     ```html
    2W<sub>tot</sub> =  Q<sub>2</sub>V<sub>23</sub> + Q<sub>1</sub>V<sub>13</sub> + Q<sub>1</sub>V<sub>12</sub> + Q<sub>2</sub>V<sub>21</sub> + Q<sub>3</sub>V<sub>31</sub> + Q<sub>3</sub>V<sub>32</sub>
    = Q<sub>1</sub>(V<sub>12</sub> + V<sub>13</sub>) + Q<sub>2</sub>(V<sub>21</sub> + V<sub>23</sub>) + Q<sub>3</sub>(V<sub>31</sub> + V<sub>32</sub>)
    ```

*   **General Expression (for N point charges):**

    ```html
    W<sub>E</sub> = (1/2) Σ<sub>k=1</sub><sup>N</sup> Q<sub>k</sub>V<sub>k</sub>
    ```
    Where:
        * W<sub>E</sub> is the total electrostatic energy.
        * Q<sub>k</sub> is the *k*-th charge
        * V<sub>k</sub> is the electric potential at the location of the *k*-th charge due to *all other charges*.

* **For continuous distributions:**

   * **Line Charge:** `W<sub>E</sub> = (1/2) ∫<sub>l'</sub> ρ<sub>l</sub>V dl'`
   * **Surface Charge:** `W<sub>E</sub> = (1/2) ∫<sub>s'</sub> ρ<sub>s</sub>V ds'`
   * **Volume Charge:** `W<sub>E</sub> = (1/2) ∫<sub>v'</sub> ρ<sub>v</sub>V dv'`

## Stored Potential Energy Field Expression

* We can also express the electrostatic energy in terms of the electric field itself, rather than the charges and potentials:

    Using the relationship `ρ<sub>v</sub> = ∇ ⋅ <b>D</b>`, and through vector manipulation, we can derive:

    ```html
    W<sub>E</sub> = (1/2) ∫<sub>v'</sub> ρ<sub>v</sub>V dv' = (1/2) ∫<sub>v'</sub> <b>D</b> ⋅ <b>E</b> dv' = (1/2) ∫<sub>v'</sub> ε<sub>0</sub>E<sup>2</sup> dv'
    ```

* **Energy Density (w<sub>E</sub>):**

    The *electrostatic energy density* (w<sub>E</sub>) represents the energy stored per unit volume:
    ```html
    w<sub>E</sub> = (1/2)<b>D</b> ⋅ <b>E</b> = (1/2)ε<sub>0</sub>E<sup>2</sup>
    ```

    The total energy is then the integral of the energy density over the volume:

    ```html
    W<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>v'</sub> w<sub>E</sub> dv'
    ```

Okay, here's a comprehensive set of notes derived from the Ansys Magnetostatics in Free Space PPT, incorporating Markdown and HTML where appropriate for clarity and presentation:

# Magnetostatics in Free Space - Ansys Innovation Course

## Sources

The material in this course is primarily based on the following textbooks:

*   "Elements of Electromagnetics," by Matthew N.O Sadiku, 5th ed. (2010)
*   "Engineering Electromagnetics," by Nathan Ida, 3rd ed. (2015)
*   "Microwave Engineering," by David Pozar, 4th ed. (2012)

## Introduction to Magnetic Fields

Before diving into the mechanics of magnetic fields, it's crucial to define some fundamental terms and concepts:

### Electromagnetic Constant

*   **μ₀ (Magnetic Permeability of Free Space):**  This constant represents the ability of a vacuum to support the formation of a magnetic field. Its value is 4π x 10⁻⁷ Henries per meter (H/m).

### Fundamental Magnetic Fields

*   **H (Magnetic Field Intensity):** Measured in Amperes per meter (A/m),  **H** represents the magnetizing force produced by electric currents.  It's a measure of *how* the magnetic field is being generated.

*   **B (Magnetic Flux Density):** Measured in Tesla (T), **B** quantifies the strength and direction of the magnetic field.  It represents the *effect* of the magnetic field, i.e., the force it exerts on moving charges.

*   **Relationship in Vacuum:** In a vacuum (and for this course, we primarily focus on free space), the relationship between **B** and **H** is simple:

    ```
    B = μ₀H
    ```

### Fundamental Field Sources

*   **Q (Electric Charge):**  Measured in Coulombs (C).  Stationary electric charges produce electric fields.

*   **J (Electric Current Density):** Measured in Amperes per square meter (A/m²).  This represents the flow of electric charge.  Moving charges (currents) are the primary source of magnetic fields.

### How Magnetic Fields Arise

Magnetic fields are generated by *moving* electric charges.  This motion can take several forms:

1.  **Electric Current:**  A flow of electrons through a wire creates a magnetic field around the wire. The field lines form concentric circles around the wire (as illustrated in the PPT).

2.  **Electrons Orbiting Atoms:**  The motion of electrons within atoms also generates magnetic fields.  In some materials (ferromagnetic materials), these atomic-level magnetic fields can align, leading to a strong overall magnetic field (as in a permanent magnet).

3.  **Changing Electric Fields (Important Note):** Although the course focuses on *magnetostatics* (time-invariant fields), it's important to remember that changing electric fields can also *induce* magnetic fields. This is a key concept in electromagnetism but is beyond the scope of this introductory section.

### Magnetic Flux (Ψ)

Magnetic flux is a measure of the "amount" of magnetic field passing through a given surface.  It's calculated as the surface integral of the magnetic flux density (**B**) over that surface (**S**):

```html
Ψ = ∫<sub>S</sub> B ⋅ ds
```

Where:

*   **Ψ** is the magnetic flux (measured in Webers, Wb).
*   **B** is the magnetic flux density.
*   **ds** is a differential vector element of the surface, pointing perpendicularly outward from the surface.
* The dot product indicates that only the magnetic flux that is normal or perpendicular to the surface will get counted toward the total flux.

This integral essentially sums up the contributions of the magnetic field lines passing through the surface.

## Magnetic Monopoles and Dipoles

### The Absence of Magnetic Monopoles

A crucial difference between electric and magnetic fields lies in the existence of monopoles.

*   **Electric Monopoles Exist:**  Positive and negative electric charges can exist independently.  A single positive charge creates an electric field that radiates outward, and a single negative charge creates an electric field that converges inward.

*   **Magnetic Monopoles *Do Not* Exist (as far as we know):**  Unlike electric charges, magnetic monopoles (isolated "north" or "south" poles) have never been observed.  All known magnetic fields are *dipolar*, meaning they always have both a north and a south pole.

### Magnetic Dipoles

*   **Dipole Nature:**  Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.  They emerge from a "north" pole and enter a "south" pole, and crucially, the field lines *continue* inside the magnetic material, forming a complete loop.

*   **Lowest Order:**  A dipole is the simplest (lowest-order) magnetic field configuration.  Higher-order configurations (quadrupoles, octupoles, etc.) exist, but they can be thought of as combinations of dipoles.

### The Solenoidal Law (No Magnetic Monopoles)

The non-existence of magnetic monopoles is formalized by the **Solenoidal Law**, which states that the divergence of the magnetic flux density (**B**) is always zero:

```
∇ ⋅ B = 0
```

In integral form, this is expressed as:

```html
∮<sub>S</sub> B ⋅ ds = 0
```

This means that the net magnetic flux through *any* closed surface is always zero.  Any magnetic field lines that enter a closed surface must also exit it.  There's no "magnetic charge" enclosed within the surface. This is the magnetic equivalent of Gauss's law for electricity.

## Ampere's Law in a Vacuum

Ampere's Law describes the relationship between electric current and the magnetic field it produces.

### Point Form

The point form (differential form) of Ampere's Law in a vacuum states:

```
∇ × B = μ₀J
```

Where:

*   **∇ × B** is the curl of the magnetic flux density.  The curl describes the "circulation" or "rotation" of the magnetic field.
*   **μ₀** is the permeability of free space.
*   **J** is the electric current density.

This equation tells us that a current density (**J**) creates a circulating magnetic field (**B**).

### Integral Form

The integral form of Ampere's Law is often more practical for calculations:

```html
∮<sub>C</sub> B ⋅ dl = μ₀I<sub>tot</sub>
```
Or, equivalently
```html
∮<sub>C</sub> B ⋅ dl = μ₀ ∮<sub>S</sub> J ⋅ ds
```

Where:

*   **∮<sub>C</sub> B ⋅ dl** is the line integral of the magnetic flux density (**B**) around a closed loop (contour) *C*.
*   **μ₀** is the permeability of free space.
*   **I<sub>tot</sub>** is the total current enclosed by the loop *C*.  This is equal to the surface integral of the current density J over any surface S that is bounded by the loop C.
* **dl** is an infinitessimal vector along the contour C.

This form states that the circulation of the magnetic field around a closed loop is proportional to the total current passing through that loop.

### Example: Magnetic Field Around a Wire

The PPT uses the example of an infinitely long, straight wire carrying a current *I*.  By choosing a circular Amperian loop of radius *r* centered on the wire, and exploiting the symmetry of the problem (the magnetic field has constant magnitude along the loop and is tangent to the loop), the integral form of Ampere's Law simplifies:

```
B * 2πr = μ₀I
```

Therefore:

```
B = (μ₀I) / (2πr)
```

This shows that the magnetic field strength decreases inversely with the distance from the wire.

## Magnetic Vector Potential (A)

The magnetic vector potential (**A**) is a mathematical tool that simplifies the calculation of magnetic fields.

### Definition

The magnetic vector potential is defined such that its curl is equal to the magnetic flux density:

```
B = ∇ × A
```

### Motivation

This definition is motivated by the Solenoidal Law (∇ ⋅ B = 0) and a vector identity:

```
∇ ⋅ (∇ × A) = 0  (for any vector A)
```

Since the divergence of the curl of any vector is always zero, we can *always* find a vector potential **A** that satisfies B = ∇ × A.

### Usefulness

The real power of the magnetic vector potential comes from substituting its definition into Ampere's Law:

```
∇ × B = ∇ × (∇ × A) = μ₀J
```

Using another vector identity:

```
∇ × (∇ × A) = ∇(∇ ⋅ A) - ∇²A
```

We get:

```
∇(∇ ⋅ A) - ∇²A = μ₀J
```

Now, we exploit the *Helmholtz Theorem*, which states that a vector field is uniquely defined by its curl and its divergence.  We already know the curl of **A** (it's **B**).  We are free to choose the divergence of **A** to be whatever is most convenient.  The common choice is:

```
∇ ⋅ A = 0  (This is called the Coulomb gauge)
```

This simplifies the equation to:

```
∇²A = -μ₀J
```

This is a vector Poisson equation, analogous to the scalar Poisson equation for the electric potential in electrostatics.

### Solution

The solution to this differential equation (for a volume current distribution) is:

```html
A = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫<sub>v'</sub> (J / |r - r'|) dv'
```

Where:

*   **A** is the magnetic vector potential at a point **r**.
*   **μ₀** is the permeability of free space.
*   **J** is the current density at a point **r'** within the volume *v'*.
*   **|r - r'|** is the distance between the observation point **r** and the source point **r'**.
*   *dv'* is a differential volume element.

Once **A** is found, the magnetic flux density **B** can be calculated by taking the curl:

```
B = ∇ × A
```

## Magnetic Force Law

### Force on a Moving Charge

A magnetic field exerts a force on a moving charge.  The force is given by:

```
F<sub>m</sub> = q(u × B)
```

Where:

*   **F<sub>m</sub>** is the magnetic force.
*   *q* is the charge.
*   **u** is the velocity of the charge.
*   **B** is the magnetic flux density.
*   **×** denotes the cross product.

The direction of the force is perpendicular to both the velocity of the charge and the magnetic field, determined by the right-hand rule.

### Lorentz Force Law

The total electromagnetic force on a charged particle is the sum of the electric force and the magnetic force:

```
F = q(E + u × B)
```

This is the Lorentz Force Law.

### Force on a Current-Carrying Wire

For a current-carrying wire, the force on a differential element of the wire is:

```
dF<sub>m</sub> = I(dl × B)
```

Where:

*   **dF<sub>m</sub>** is the differential magnetic force.
*   *I* is the current.
*   **dl** is a differential length vector along the wire, pointing in the direction of the current.
*   **B** is the magnetic flux density.

## Biot-Savart Law

The Biot-Savart Law provides a direct way to calculate the magnetic field produced by a steady current.

### Derivation (Conceptual)

The derivation combines Ampere's Law and the magnetic force law, considering the interaction between two current loops.

### Equation

The Biot-Savart Law for the magnetic flux density **B** at a point **r** due to a current element *I* **dl'** at a point **r'** is:

```html
dB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I dl' × (r - r')) / |r - r'|³
```
The total field is found from the following integral:
```html
B = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ (I dl' × (r - r')) / |r - r'|³
```

Or, for a volume current distribution:

```html
B = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫<sub>v'</sub> (J × (r - r')) / |r - r'|³ dv'
```
Where:
* dl' is a differential current element.
* (r - r') is the difference vector from the source to the observation point.

Where:

*   **B** is the magnetic flux density at point **r**.
*   **μ₀** is the permeability of free space.
*   *I* is the current.
*   **dl'** is a differential length vector of the current element at point **r'**.
*    **(r - r')** is the vector pointing from the current element to the observation point.
*   **|r - r'|** is the distance between the current element and the observation point.
* **J** is current density.
* *v'* is the current-carrying volume.

### Key Points

*   **Time-Invariant Currents:** The Biot-Savart Law, as presented here, applies only to *steady* (time-invariant) currents.
*   **Direct Calculation:** Unlike Ampere's Law, which is often used for highly symmetric situations, the Biot-Savart Law can be used (in principle) to calculate the magnetic field for *any* current distribution, although the integration can be complex.

## Magnetic Scalar Potential (Vm)

In regions where the current density (**J**) is zero, it's sometimes useful to define a magnetic scalar potential, *V<sub>m</sub>*, analogous to the electric potential in electrostatics.

### Definition

```
B = -μ₀∇V<sub>m</sub>
```
Where:
* Vm is the magnetic scalar potential.

### Limitation

This definition is only valid in regions where **J** = 0.  If **J** is not zero, the curl of **B** is non-zero (Ampere's Law), and **B** cannot be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential.
