I converted PDFs to JSON with AI. I did multiple attempts for this. Apply this assessment suite on all these converted JSON files to assess them and tell me which ones rank highest. I am providing you with the original PDFs and the JSON files here

Schema for the JSON is PdfDocument. Here it is:

class PdfPageContent(BaseModel):
    """
    Represents the extracted content structure of a single PDF page,
    likely exported from a presentation slide.
    """
    page_number: int
    section: Optional[str]                       # e.g., Chapter number, broad topic
    title: Optional[str]                         # Main title text on the page/slide
    text_content: List[str]                      # List of distinct text blocks or paragraphs
    image_descriptions: List[str]                # List of descriptions for images found

@register_schema
class PdfDocument(BaseModel):
    """
    Represents the structured content extracted from multiple pages of a PDF document.
    """
    pages: List[PdfPageContent]   



# Quantitative Assessment Suite for JSON Conversion (Score out of 100 + 40 Bonus)

(Focus: Data Fidelity within Provided Schema; Technical Correctness as Bonus)

---

# 1. Unified Assessment Criterion: Data Fidelity within the Provided Schema (Total Base Score: 100 points)

This evaluates how accurately, completely, and correctly the generated output populates the fields of the specific JSON schema provided, using information extracted from the source content. Score is determined by assessing the quality across all relevant data points and deducting points for errors/omissions.

## 1.1. Accuracy of Populated Values (Max Score: 25 points)
*Assess if values are correct, contextually sound, and specific.*
- Exact Match: Do values (text, numbers, facts) in schema fields precisely match the source? (Deduct points per significant inaccuracy)
- Contextual Correctness: Does the extracted value make sense given the surrounding data in the source and schema context? (Deduct points for context errors)
- Specificity/Granularity: Is the most specific and appropriate information extracted for the designated field? (Deduct points for lack of specificity)

## 1.2. Completeness of Relevant Data (Max Score: 20 points)
*Assess if all expected data is captured and absence is handled correctly.*
- Coverage: Is all source information that corresponds to a field in the schema captured and placed? (Deduct points per significant omission)
- Handling Source Absence: How is missing source information for schema fields handled (correct omission for optional fields, appropriate use of `null`, no hallucinated/invented data)? (Deduct points for incorrect handling or hallucination)

## 1.3. Correct Mapping to Schema Fields (Max Score: 25 points)
*Assess if data is placed in the correct fields.*
- Semantic Placement: Is source information consistently mapped to the semantically correct key defined in the schema? (Deduct significant points per mapping error, as this is crucial)
- Disambiguation Logic: If the source offers multiple candidates for a single schema field, was reasonable logic applied for selection? (Deduct points for poor/incorrect disambiguation)

## 1.4. Appropriate Representation & Normalization (Max Score: 10 points)
*Assess if data types and formats enhance usability.*
- Basic Type Fidelity: Are fundamental data types preserved (numbers as numbers, etc.) aligned with the field's implied intent? (Deduct points for incorrect typing)
- Format Normalization: Is there adherence to common/expected formats (dates, codes, whitespace)? (Deduct points for inconsistent or poor formatting)

## 1.5. Consistency within Schema Arrays (Max Score: 15 points)
*Assess uniformity for list/array items.*
- Uniform Application: Are all the above checks (Accuracy, Completeness, Mapping, Representation) applied consistently and correctly for every element within arrays defined by the schema? (Deduct points based on the frequency and severity of inconsistencies across array elements)

## 1.6. Handling of Ambiguity/Uncertainty (Max Score: 5 points)
*Assess how unclear source information is managed.*
- Management: How are genuine source ambiguities or conflicting information points handled regarding schema fields (e.g., ignored, mapped to `null`, noted if schema allows)? (Award points based on reasonable handling; deduct if handled poorly or ignored leading to errors. Full points if no ambiguity exists and thus no handling needed).

---

# 2. Bonus Criterion: Technical Formatting (Total Bonus Score: 40 points)

This assesses the technical correctness and strict schema adherence, considered secondary to Data Fidelity.

## 2.1. JSON Validity (Max Bonus: 20 points)
- Is the output syntactically correct JSON that can be parsed without errors? (Award full 20 points if valid, 0 points if invalid)

## 2.2. Strict Schema Conformance (Max Bonus: 20 points)
- Does the output precisely adhere to all constraints defined in the provided JSON schema (e.g., required fields, data types, enums, patterns, value ranges)? (Award points proportionally based on the degree of conformance. Deduct points for each violation, weighting severity - e.g., missing required field is worse than incorrect string pattern).

---

## How to Apply Summary:

- **Calculate Base Score (Max 100):** Sum the points awarded across sections 1.1 to 1.6. Start with the maximum possible points for each subsection and deduct based on identified errors.
- **Calculate Bonus Score (Max 40):** Sum the points awarded for sections 2.1 and 2.2.
- **Total Score:** Base Score + Bonus Score (Maximum possible: 140).
