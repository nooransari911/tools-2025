compare mobility of resupply/logistics of modern artillery (self-propelled or towed) to resupply/logistics of modern rockets/MLRS. assume equivalent ranges. i think you would need to deal with 105 mm class and 155 mm class artillery seperately. first do comparison and then form a comprehensive rational fair evaluation/assessment based on the evaluations

Mobility includes:
- strategic mobility: mobility to get into/out of broader theater/region
- constrains on transport (mainly strategic but also otherwise) platform due to weight
- operational mobility: mobility within theater between diff firing positions
- tactical mobility: move-after-fire ("shoot-and-scoot")
- mobility on roads and cross-country in max speed, ability to do so without getting damaged, degree of cross-country that can be traversed, etc.


Be careful in comaprisons. towed artillery is extremely light, but strategic mobility will be limited by prime mover trucks. airlift 100 towed artillery means nothing if you cannot also airlift req amount of movers.

First do comparison and then form a comprehensive rational fair evaluation/assessment based on the evaluations. Engage with this entire message holistically; it has numerous arguments and points, but don't see them complete isolation. here is what I think:

vs rockets, artillery needs has much larger logistical footprint as it needs more individual stuff for resupply (projectile, propellant/charge, fuze, etc.), loading/unloading resupply a much longer time, needs to be done much closer to firing position/frontline due to severely impaired mobility (slower rate of fire and longer resupply times mean crew and equipment is vulnerable for a very long amount of time). MRLS RSV is highly specialized and of very high value to adversary, meaning it is much more likely to be targetted and subsequent impact of loss of RSV can be catastrophic, engaging 100 artillery RSVs would be more expensive and intensive, but I believe adversary would still pursue it as:
- it suppresses future fire,
- artillery on frontline becomes a sitting duck (MRLS can easily retreat in event of uncertainty of resupply),
- artillery would be forced to retreat, creating complete chaos
- loss of RSV can be particularly demoralizing for arty personnel; again MRLS personnel can easily retreat in uncertainty
- retreat would catastrophically destroy all planning due to time taking for emplace/displace, especially for towed artillery



Artillery resupply might have generic signature of a truck, but 100 trucks in and around the frontline can be most definitely considered legitimate military targets even if they cannot be explicitly identified as artillery resupply vehicles. They form a very substantial signature. Given the payoff (chaos, disruption, potentially demoralize), one can reasonably expect adversary to aggressively target all trucks around the frontline.

MRLS RSV have unique signatures. They can be explicitly identified as MRLS RSV. But with proper use, they can be much harder to find. Combined with general mobility of MRLS launchers, RSvs can be disperesed over a very wide region.

Engaging 100 artillery RSVs is a much larger scale operation vs engaging one MRLS RSV, but still, adversary would most definitely pursue it. Artillery RSV is more resilient to loss of individual RSVs, but given the opportunity, adversary would never engage only individual artillery RSVs





Ergo I believe older and towed artillery, and to lesser extent modern self-propelled arty, is a "death trap" and categorically inferior to rockets, almost to the point of being useless in modern cutting-edge military. Do not tunnel vision into this hyperbole or specific parts of this message; i am not making blanket unsubstantiated hyperboles; engage with my entire message. engage with this message in its entirety, not fragmenting it and treating everything in message in isolation. I make case for arty and SPG as well, not just against it. Do not overlook that.

Neutralizing adversary military equipment and infrastructure is the core goal in modern militaries; area suppression is extremely niche and non-standard and can be considered obsolete. They can be quite cost-effective against super weak adversaries, but that (less sophisticated nature of said adversaries) only further proves their inferiority. Military needs to deal with all kinds of adversaries, including less sophisticated ones. Arty is excellent then. But arty, especially towed and less advanced kinds, should be seen as death trap or at the very least extremely manpower and logistically intensive. It cannot be expected to form the absolute cutting edge of military, not against any peer adversary. Only highly advanced modern artillery like archer, PzH 2000 can be deemed acceptable. Archer is about as close an arty can get to MLRS.

technically, artillery is categorically inferior to rockets:
- they have much lower rate of fire, emplace/displace times, reload times, meaning crew and equipment is highly vulnerable for much much longer times;
- impaired mobility means they are sort-of "stuck" on the frontline; MRLS can retreat to reload or take cover or avoid suspected counter fires; (this and above point make it a death trap)
- lower rate of fire along with potentially lower precision reduces impact. 4 rockets hitting critical targets simulatenously with high precision produces much much higher impact than 1 artillery shell every minute;
- artillery tops out at around 100-200 km, while 100-200 km is trivial (at least technically and theoretically) for rockets. Rockets can easily reach 1000s of kms (i recognize such rockets have completely different role and are irrelevant, but still, they show superior technical limits of rockets);
- generally need more crew as its more manual, labor intensive;
- potentially lower accuracy;
- as previously established, extremely vulnerable and fragile resupply (This is achilles heel of SPGs as well)


Modern SPGs counter almost all of problems of towed artillery, but weight of such mdoern advanced SPGs severely impair mobility; they may have 90 km/h top speeds, but their weight works against them in achieving said speeds, getting strategic mobility, attaining tactically advantageous positions/locations. there are lighter SPGs, but they aren't as good. achillles heel of resupply remains
