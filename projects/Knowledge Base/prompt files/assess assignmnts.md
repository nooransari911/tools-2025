From these versions/iterations of a assignment, pick the best version, the assignmenet that would be best accepted. Strongly not recommended, but if picking a single version is challenging or if the best version has critical flaw that would make it unacceptable, synthesis a new one using all these versions.

Make sure that you are not biased towards the latter iterations, implicitly assuming they were built upon all previous iterations and thus the naturally the best
