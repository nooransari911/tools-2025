Consider a course. The LMS presentation was horrible. I have taken the HTML from the course LMS page. So from the HTML, synthesize markdown document. Make sure:
1. There is zero loss of information or content. This is critical
2. You properly structure the markdown file into sections-subsections using heading. This is also critical. Be thoughful about the structure
3. Rewrite unclear or confusing sections
4. Avoid improper use of bulelts. Paragraph style is better suited for some content, don't use bullets for them.
5. Where depth appears too little, add depth as well.
6. Avoid excess use of bold.
