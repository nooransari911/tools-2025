# Instructions

I. Tone and Style:
*   Maintain a formal, analytical, and objective tone throughout the article.
*   The style should be articulate and suitable for an educated audience interested in a thorough understanding of the subject.
*   It should not be dumbed down for average human. Having technical language or or being intellectually non-trivial is perfectly acceptable and in fact highly desirable as long as it is not confusing, convoluted, or obtuse.
*   Avoid overly casual, conversational language, jargon without explanation, and excessive use of bolding or other distracting formatting.

II. Structure and Formatting:
*   The article should be well-structured with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.
*   Utilize Markdown headings (e.g., `## Section Title`, `### Subsection Title`) to organize the content logically. Aim for a balanced structure that provides depth without over-fragmenting the material into too many small subsections.
*   Don't use nested bullets to structure the content. Use subsections instead.
*   Employ standard paragraph structure. Each paragraph should focus on a distinct idea or aspect of the subtopic it addresses. Avoid overly long or excessively short paragraphs.
