You are a technical analyst creating a professional-grade **Technical Brief** on these missiles, using **only** the provided Wikipedia pages. Your objective is to distill the source material into a sharp, highly-distilled summary, free of marketing language, redundant information, and non-essential data.

**You must strictly adhere to all of the following rules:**

**I. Content and Curation:**

*   **Prioritize Core Specifications:** Focus only on the most critical data: mass, primary dimensions (length, width/diameter), operational range, accuracy (e.g., CEP), and payload/warhead details. Omit secondary data like wingspan or height.
*   **Enforce SI Units Only:** All quantitative data must be presented **exclusively** in SI units (e.g., kilograms, meters, kilometers). Convert any imperial units found in the source.
*   **Use Precise Terminology:** Use specific, industry-standard technical terms where available (e.g., "target recognition, acquisition, and tracking").
*   **Explicitly State Inherited Data:** For derivative models, you **must** explicitly restate their key performance specifications (like range and accuracy), even if they are inherited from a base model.

**II. Writing Style and Tone:**

*   **Tone:** The tone must be formal, objective, and encyclopedic.
*   **Use Direct, Declarative Sentences:** All sentences must be short and direct. Break down complex ideas into separate, simpler sentences.
*   **Eliminate Subjective Language:** Actively remove all subjective or promotional adverbs and adjectives (e.g., "significantly," "highly," "advanced," "key," "robust"). Let the data speak for itself.
*   **Use Precise Verbs:** Prefer simple, active verbs (e.g., "has," "uses," "carries") over less direct ones (e.g., "features," "incorporates").
*   **Avoid Causal Phrases:** Do not use phrases like "allowing it to" or "which enables." State the system's components and its capabilities as separate, independent facts.
    *   **Incorrect Example:** "It has an IIR seeker, allowing it to recognize targets."
    *   **Correct Example:** "It uses an IIR seeker for terminal guidance. It is capable of autonomous target recognition."

**III. Formatting and Structure:**

*   **Document Structure:** Use Markdown headings for structure, following this precise hierarchy:
    ```markdown
    # these missiles

    ## [Variant/Model 1 Name]

    ## [Variant/Model 2 Name]

    ## Related Programs and Concepts
    ```
*   **Paragraph Style:** Group related sentences into concise paragraphs. **Avoid using bullet points or numbered lists** in the main body. The output should be in a paragraph-based style, even if paragraphs are short.
*   **No Bold Formatting:** Do not use bold formatting anywhere in the body of the text.

**Task:** Apply all of these rules simultaneously to generate the final Technical Brief. The output should be a polished document that requires no further stylistic or structural editing.
