Consider these questions for oral exam for subject "Power Devices and Circuits". Answer them. The answer is supposed to just briefly highlight the points that need to be covered by me to give a satisfactory answer. I will not be memorizing your response, so proper long sentences is counter productive. Avoid use of bold. Merge extremely similar questions, though don't be aggressive about this. Explicitly include the question as well. Also Build a proper sections-subsections structure using markdown heading. Use headings to create structure, not nested bullet points. Also group questions that belong to similar unit together. Each unit is H1 heading level. This is the syllabus that shows units:

In a previous attempt, here is your response. I like the structure of this. Use similar structure.

# Unit I: Study of Power Devices

## Latching and Holding Current (Questions 1, 2, 3)

### Latching Current (IL)
- Minimum anode current required to maintain the SCR in the ON state immediately after the gate signal is removed.
- Must be reached during turn-on for the device to stay on.
- Typically higher than the holding current.

### Holding Current (IH)
- Minimum anode current required to keep the SCR in the forward conduction state (ON state).
- If anode current falls below IH, the SCR turns OFF.
- Lower than the latching current.

### Difference between Latching and Holding Current
- Latching current relates to the turn-on process.
- Holding current relates to maintaining the ON state (turn-off condition).
- IL > IH.

## Differences: SCR, MOSFET, IGBT (Question 4)

### SCR (Silicon Controlled Rectifier)
- Type: Thyristor family, current-controlled device.
- Structure: Four layers (PNPN).
- Control: Gate current pulse turns ON, anode current falling below holding current turns OFF (or reverse voltage).
- Switching Speed: Slow.
- Voltage/Current Ratings: High voltage, high current.
- Conduction Loss: Low.
- Application: High power AC control, rectifiers.

### Power MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor)
- Type: Field-effect transistor, voltage-controlled device.
- Structure: Three layers (based on N-channel or P-channel).
- Control: Gate-Source voltage (VGS) controls ON/OFF state.
- Switching Speed: Very fast.
- Voltage/Current Ratings: Lower voltage, moderate current (improving with SiC/GaN).
- Conduction Loss: Higher at high currents (RDS(on)).
- Application: High-frequency converters (SMPS), low/medium power applications.

### IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor)
- Type: Hybrid of MOSFET and BJT, voltage-controlled device.
- Structure: Combines MOSFET gate input with bipolar output characteristics.
- Control: Gate-Emitter voltage (VGE) controls ON/OFF state.
- Switching Speed: Medium (faster than SCR, slower than MOSFET).
- Voltage/Current Ratings: High voltage, high current.
- Conduction Loss: Low (like BJT/SCR).
- Application: Medium/high power, medium frequency (motor drives, inverters).

## Turning ON SCR, MOSFET, IGBT (Question 5)

### SCR
- Apply a positive gate current (IG) between gate and cathode while the anode-cathode voltage (VAK) is positive.
- Anode current must rise above latching current.
- Other methods (less common): High dv/dt, high temperature, light activation (LASCR), high forward voltage (breakover).

### MOSFET
- Apply a positive voltage (VGS) between gate and source (for N-channel enhancement type) that exceeds the threshold voltage (Vth).
- Creates a conduction channel between drain and source.

### IGBT
- Apply a positive voltage (VGE) between gate and emitter that exceeds the threshold voltage (Vth).
- Controls conductivity between collector and emitter.

## Comparison: SCR, DIAC, TRIAC (Question 6)

### SCR
- Unidirectional switch (conducts current anode to cathode).
- Three terminals: Anode, Cathode, Gate.
- Turned ON by gate signal.

### DIAC (Diode for Alternating Current)
- Bidirectional switch (conducts in both directions).
- Two terminals (often called MT1, MT2 or Anode 1, Anode 2).
- Turns ON when voltage across it exceeds breakover voltage (VBO) in either direction.
- No gate terminal. Primarily used to trigger TRIACs.

### TRIAC (Triode for Alternating Current)
- Bidirectional switch (like two SCRs back-to-back with a common gate).
- Three terminals: MT1, MT2, Gate.
- Can be triggered ON by positive or negative gate current, regardless of MT2 voltage polarity (relative to MT1).
- Used for AC power control (dimmers, speed control).

## Limitations: SCR, MOSFET, IGBT (Question 7)

### SCR
- Slow switching speed limits operating frequency.
- Turn-off requires reducing anode current below IH or reverse biasing (commutation circuits needed in DC applications).
- Gate has no turn-off capability.

### MOSFET
- Higher conduction losses at high currents (RDS(on)).
- Lower voltage/current ratings compared to SCR/IGBT traditionally (SiC/GaN improving this).
- Susceptible to damage from electrostatic discharge (ESD).
- Body diode has poor reverse recovery characteristics (in many standard devices).

### IGBT
- Slower switching speed than MOSFETs.
- Potential for latch-up under certain conditions (less common in modern devices).
- Tail current during turn-off can increase switching losses.

## Effect of Increasing Gate Current (SCR) (Question 8)

- Reduces the forward breakover voltage (VBO).
- Reduces the time required to turn the SCR ON (turn-on time).
- Increases noise immunity (less likely to trigger falsely due to dv/dt).
- Increases power dissipation at the gate.
- Does not significantly affect the ON-state voltage drop or holding/latching currents once turned ON.
- Excessive gate current can damage the gate junction.

## SCR Operating Modes (Forward Blocking, Forward Conduction) (Question 9)

### Forward Blocking Mode
- Anode is positive with respect to Cathode.
- Gate signal is not applied (or is insufficient).
- Only a small leakage current flows from anode to cathode.
- SCR acts like an open switch, blocking the forward voltage.

### Forward Conduction Mode
- Anode is positive with respect to Cathode.
- Sufficient gate current is applied (or anode voltage exceeds VBO).
- SCR turns ON and conducts current from anode to cathode.
- Voltage drop across the SCR becomes very low (typically 1-2V).
- Acts like a closed switch.
- Remains ON as long as anode current is above holding current, even if gate signal is removed.

(Also Reverse Blocking Mode: Anode is negative w.r.t Cathode, SCR blocks reverse voltage like a diode).

## VI Characteristics: SCR, MOSFET, IGBT (Question 10)

### SCR
- Three regions: Reverse Blocking, Forward Blocking, Forward Conduction.
- Forward Blocking: High voltage, low leakage current until VBO (or gate trigger).
- Forward Conduction: Low voltage drop (1-2V), current determined by external circuit (once above IH).
- Reverse Blocking: Behaves like a diode, blocks reverse voltage until reverse breakdown.
- Gate current shifts the transition from forward blocking to forward conduction to lower anode voltages.

### Power MOSFET (Enhancement N-Channel)
- Output Characteristics (ID vs VDS for different VGS):
    - Cut-off Region: VGS < Vth. No significant drain current (ID).
    - Ohmic/Linear Region: VGS > Vth and VDS is small. ID increases linearly with VDS. Device acts like a resistor (RDS(on)).
    - Saturation/Active Region: VGS > Vth and VDS is large. ID becomes relatively constant, controlled mainly by VGS. Used mostly in switching applications in this region or ohmic.
- Transfer Characteristics (ID vs VGS): Shows negligible ID until VGS reaches Vth, then ID increases (typically quadratically).

### IGBT
- Output Characteristics (IC vs VCE for different VGE):
    - Similar shape to BJT characteristics but controlled by VGE.
    - Cut-off Region: VGE < Vth. No significant collector current (IC).
    - Active Region: VGE > Vth. IC rises with VCE and then flattens, controlled by VGE.
    - ON state has low voltage drop (VCE(sat)), similar to BJT.
- Transfer Characteristics (IC vs VGE): Shows negligible IC until VGE reaches Vth, then IC increases.

## MOSFET Modes (Enhancement/Depletion) (Question 11)

### Enhancement Mode (E-MOSFET)
- Most common type for power electronics.
- No conductive channel exists between Drain and Source at VGS = 0.
- Applying a gate voltage (VGS > Vth for N-channel, VGS < Vth for P-channel) *enhances* the region under the gate, creating a conductive channel.
- Device is normally OFF.

### Depletion Mode (D-MOSFET)
- A conductive channel exists between Drain and Source even at VGS = 0.
- Applying a gate voltage can either:
    - Enhance the channel further (making it more conductive) by applying one polarity of VGS.
    - Deplete the channel (making it less conductive or turning it OFF) by applying the opposite polarity of VGS (VGS < 0 for N-channel, VGS > 0 for P-channel).
- Device is normally ON (at VGS=0).
- Less common in power switching applications.
