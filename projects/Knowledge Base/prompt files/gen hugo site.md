Look this HTML page for my static website. It fetches all markdown content from a single file and presents them on single page.

Now I want to migrate to hugo. Suggest how to build hugo list pages, single pages, markdown front matter. What are my options. Note that I am not looking to my existing solution to hugo as-is or as much as possible. I just want to migrate content to hugo: new hugo site with these content. How similar it is to my exisiting soltuion and whether or not it achieves equivalent/similar functionality is completely irrelevant.





Content is long form articles/essays. Minimal if any images, dynamic content, etc., just pure text heavy. Though do not explicitly optimize out of images, links, etc. Note that you should use standard idiomatic hugo approach of single pages and list pages, not dynamically fetch every single file and displaying all files on a single page like in my existing setup. So you are not supposed to dynamically fetch content like here. Follow general reccommended best practices for hugo (similar to software dev principles/ideals like highly modular, reusable code, single responsibility principle, DRY, etc.). Ideally built HTML page would be strictly static. Also, my existing setup is very clean, aesthetic, modern. Ensure your approach would also yield an aesthetic modern solution. I don't strictly need you to use colors, style, etc. as-is from given CSS, if at all, just it should have dark mode with gray/black bg and look exceptional and modern.

Do not jump the guns, do not prematurely generate entire site yet, this is a strict instruction. Just tell me strategy/parameters/options in markdown front matter, layout, pages, etc. I want to explore how to do it.

Start completely from scratch; it is perfectly acceptable to not use anything (style, layout, colors, packages, logic, etc.) from the provided html/css.




Generate all files for completely new Hugo website along with themes, layouts, etc., basically everything.
