Radar warning reciever on fighter jet are virtually useless.

missiles have extremely high speeds and target cannot pull arbitrarily high G maneuveurs, especially if its manned. Fixed-winged aircraft have strict limitations on their manueveurs due to stall and airframe. Evasion are almost always extremely difficult to successfully pull off and often downright impossible. Even if evasion is successful, it can still cause significant disruption and chaos, virtually failing the target's mission. Target can try jamming, but that almost certainly gives away their existence/location anyways. Countermeasures like chaff, flare, ECCM, etc. exist, but their success is dependent on sheer luck and will still disrupt target's mission. Target cannot just deploy these and simply continue on its mission.

Put differently, A warning that target can do virtually nothing about is as good as a warning that never existed.
