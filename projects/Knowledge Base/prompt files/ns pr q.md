 From this dump of questions-answers for oral for subject "Network Security", prepare converged unified coherent material. The answer is supposed to just briefly highlight the points that need to be covered by me to give a satisfactory answer. I will not be memorizing your response, so proper long sentences is counter productive. Avoid use of bold. Merge extremely similar questions, though don't be aggressive about this. Explicitly include the question as well. Also Build a proper sections-subsections structure using markdown heading. Use headings to create structure, not nested bullet points. Also group questions that belong to similar unit together. Each unit is H1 heading level. While you are at it, also fix any inconsistencies, inaccuracies, unclear wording, extremely indirect/superfluous content. This is the syllabus that shows units:

# Unit II: AC to DC Power Converters

## Converter Types (Question 15)

### Question: Difference between Full controlled converter and Semi controlled converter.
- Full Controlled Converter:
    - Uses only controllable switches (e.g., SCRs).
    - Output voltage can be positive or negative (two-quadrant or four-quadrant operation possible with appropriate configurations).
    - Allows regeneration (power flow from DC side back to AC side).
    - Example: Single-phase full bridge with 4 SCRs.
- Semi Controlled Converter (Half Controlled):
    - Uses a mix of controllable switches (SCRs) and diodes.
    - Output voltage is typically only positive (one-quadrant operation).
    - No regeneration possible.
    - Simpler control, often better power factor than full converter at high firing angles.
    - Example: Single-phase bridge with 2 SCRs and 2 Diodes.

## Firing Angle Control (Questions 16, 17)

### Question: What is purpose of controlling firing angle in converter?
- To control the average DC output voltage of the converter.
- By delaying the point (angle) in the AC cycle at which the SCRs are triggered (fired), the start of conduction is delayed, reducing the average output voltage.

### Question: Define firing angle (alpha).
- The angle (measured in degrees or radians) of the input AC voltage waveform at which the gate pulse is applied to the SCR to turn it ON.
- Measured from the point where the device *could* start conducting if it were a diode.

## Devices in Full Converters (Question 18)

- Half Bridge:
    - Uses two switches (e.g., MOSFETs/IGBTs) and two capacitors (or split DC source).
    - Output voltage swings between +Vdc/2 and -Vdc/2 (relative to midpoint).
    - Requires fewer switches but needs a center-tapped DC source or large capacitors.
- Full Bridge (H-Bridge):
    - Uses four switches.
    - Output voltage swings between +Vdc and -Vdc.
    - Can produce higher output voltage (twice the half-bridge for the same Vdc).
    - More complex but standard configuration.

### Question: O/P of bridge inverter.
- Basic square wave inverter: Output voltage is a square wave.

# Unit IV: DC to DC Converters (Choppers / SMPS)

## Chopper Basics (Questions 29, 30, 31, 32, 33)

### Question: Why step down chopper called so?
- Because the average DC output voltage (Vo) is less than the DC input voltage (Vs).
- It "chops" the input voltage, and by varying the ON time relative to the total period, the average output is controlled to be lower than the input.

### Question: Types of chopper.
- Classification by Quadrant Operation:
    - Class A: Step-down, First quadrant (Vo > 0, Io > 0).
    - Class B: Step-up, Second quadrant (Vo > 0, Io < 0).
    - Class C: Two-quadrant (Class A + Class B).
    - Class D: Two-quadrant.
    - Class E: Four-quadrant.
- Classification by Circuit Topology (SMPS types):
    - Buck (Step-down).
    - Boost (Step-up).
    - Buck-Boost (Step-down or Step-up, inverting).
    - Cuk, SEPIC, Zeta (variations).
    - Isolated: Flyback, Forward, Push-Pull, Half-Bridge, Full-Bridge.

### Question: Another name of chopper.
- DC-to-DC converter.
- Switching regulator.

### Question: Components of chopper.
- Basic step-down (Buck) chopper:
    - Power semiconductor switch (MOSFET, IGBT, BJT).
    - Diode (Freewheeling diode).
    - Inductor (Energy storage).
    - Capacitor (Output filter).
    - Control circuit (generates switching signal, e.g., PWM controller).
- Other topologies have variations in component arrangement.

### Question: Duty cycle & O/P Vtg relation.
- Duty Cycle (D): Ratio of the ON time (Ton) of the switch to the total switching period (T = Ton + Toff). D = Ton / T.
- Step-Down (Buck): Vo = D * Vs (assuming continuous conduction).
- Step-Up (Boost): Vo = Vs / (1 - D).
- Buck-Boost: Vo = -Vs * D / (1 - D).

## Switched Mode Power Supplies (SMPS) (Questions 24, 25, 26, 27, 28)

### Question: Use, application of SMPS.
- Powering virtually all modern electronics: Computers, laptops, TVs, phone chargers, servers.
- Industrial power supplies, DC-DC converters in vehicles, LED drivers.
- Advantages: High efficiency, small size, light weight compared to linear supplies.

### Question: Types of SMPS.
- Non-Isolated: Buck, Boost, Buck-Boost.
- Isolated (use transformer): Flyback, Forward, Push-Pull, Half-Bridge, Full-Bridge.

### Question: Difference between SMPS & linear power supply.
- Linear Power Supply:
    - Uses a transformer (usually 50/60Hz), rectifier, filter, and a linear regulator (transistor in active region or LDO).
    - Regulation achieved by dissipating excess power as heat in the regulator.
    - Low efficiency, bulky, heavy.
    - Low output ripple and noise.
- SMPS:
    - Uses a switch operating at high frequency (kHz to MHz), energy storage elements (inductor, capacitor), rectifier/filter, and often a high-frequency transformer for isolation/voltage scaling.
    - Regulation achieved by changing the duty cycle of the switch.
    - High efficiency, compact, lightweight.
    - Can generate more output noise/ripple (EMI).

### Question: Meaning of Switch mode in SMPS.
- Refers to the power semiconductor (MOSFET/BJT) acting as a controlled switch: either fully ON (saturation) or fully OFF (cut-off).
- Minimizes power dissipation in the switching element because either voltage or current is near zero (ideally).
- This contrasts with a linear regulator where the transistor operates in the active region with significant voltage and current simultaneously, leading to power loss (heat).

### Question: Block diagram of SMPS.
- Basic AC-DC SMPS:
    1. Input Rectifier & Filter: Converts AC input to unregulated DC.
    2. Inverter/Chopper Stage: High-frequency switch(es) chop the DC. May include high-frequency transformer for isolation and voltage scaling.
    3. Output Rectifier & Filter: Converts chopped high-frequency AC back to DC and filters it.
    4. Control Circuit: Senses output voltage/current and adjusts the duty cycle of the switch(es) via feedback (often using PWM) to maintain regulation.
- Basic DC-DC SMPS (e.g., Buck):
    1. Input DC Source.
    2. Switch (e.g., MOSFET).
    3. Energy Storage (Inductor, Diode).
    4. Output Filter (Capacitor).
    5. Control Circuit (PWM controller with feedback).

Avoid super shallow/useless/overgeneric explanations. Example: in a previous iteration, you explanation about S/MIME was: "Provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation.", "Relies on a hierarchical Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) to issue X.509 certificates.". Obviously it provides impotant security elements like confi., integrity, auth., etc. It says nothing about S/MIME. Similarly "S/MIME uses X.509 certs and PKI infra" explains nothing. It appears as a mere "fun fact" so to speak. CIphertext was defined as " Encrypted message or data, appears unintelligible without the key.", which makes common defintion of encryption as "an aglorithm that produces ciphertext" tautology and useless. Key distribution is defined as "The process of securely delivering cryptographic keys to the parties who need them to establish secure communication.", which is unnecessarily wordy. It can be better defined as "mechanism to distribute/share keys securely b/w various parties". S/MIME was explained as "Full form: Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions.
What: A standard for public key encryption and signing of MIME data (email content).
How: Provides confidentiality (encryption), integrity and authentication (digital signatures) for emails. Uses asymmetric cryptography for signatures/key exchange and symmetric for bulk encryption.
Key Management: Relies on a hierarchical Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) issuing X.509 certificates to verify identities. Integrated into many modern email clients.
", which does not look incorrect, but appears extremely superficial and without any depth. Give proper almost-textbook like explanations/definitions, within the constraints previously outlined.
