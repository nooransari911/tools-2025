# Task:
Your core task is to actively transform the provided raw information for the specified subject into a set of proper, functional study notes. This is not merely about reorganizing or summarizing the input; it's about processing, synthesizing, and rephrasing the material into a format genuinely useful for learning and review.

To achieve this transformation, please:

1.  Interpret the raw information to identify and extract the fundamental concepts, key definitions, essential facts, principles, methodologies, and illustrative examples.
2.  Actively rephrase and synthesize this information. Do not just copy-paste sections. Instead, articulate the concepts in clear, simple language suitable for notes. Note that technical, detailed content is perfectly acceptable and in fact highly desirable. "Simple" language does not mean dumbed down content.
3.  Organize the processed information into a coherent and logical structure. Employ clear headings for main topics and subheadings for sub-topics, though avoid aggressively (over) fragmentating content. Do not use explicit labels for heading labels (like "H1: H1 Heading Text"). Using all/as much as possible heading levels is not an objective here. Utilize bullet points, numbered lists, or short paragraphs to present distinct pieces of information or steps in a process. Prefer long-form paragraph style over bullet points. Avoid nesting of bullet points. 
4.  Ensure that connections between related concepts are clear. If appropriate, briefly explain how different pieces of information relate to each other.
5.  While being comprehensive in capturing key details, distill complex ideas into their clear non-convoluted form. You are NOT supposed to actively avoid use of technical language, but do not convolute/confuse reader.
6.  The goal is to create notes that are easy to read, understand, and recall. The style should be informative and direct.
7.  Remove any truly redundant information or irrelevant digressions that do not contribute to understanding the core subject matter after the primary note-taking pass. The focus should be on creating useful study material.
8.  If a specific note structure was provided above, adhere to it. Otherwise, develop a structure that best facilitates understanding of the subject.
9.  Strictly avoid using any bold formatting in the generated notes. All text should be plain.
10. You are not restricted to strictly presented information. You are free to use your information on the subjecvt as well, though be careful do not ramble on tangents/trivialities.
