# **Revised Prompt: Develop a Foundational Theoretical Framework**

# Objective

Develop a **theoretical framework document** on **[Your Chosen TOPIC Here]**. The primary goal is to explain the **fundamental concepts, core principles, and overall design philosophy** behind this topic in a **highly accessible yet informative conceptual manner**.

# Target Audience

Professionals and students seeking a solid foundational understanding without requiring prior deep technical expertise in the topic. The explanation should provide enough substance to grasp the core mechanisms conceptually.

# Key Requirements

## 1. Content Focus: Conceptual Clarity with Foundational Detail
   - Focus on the **'why' (purpose) and the 'broad strategy' or 'design philosophy'** (e.g., iterative process, layered approach, specific structural paradigm like Feistel or Substitution-Permutation Network).
   - **Introduce essential technical concepts or terms** (e.g., block size, key size, rounds, basic operation types like substitution/permutation/XOR, key schedule concept) where they are *fundamental* to understanding the core mechanism.
   - **Crucially, explain these technical elements conceptually**: Focus on *what* they are and *why* they are used within the overall strategy, not their intricate implementation details.
   - **Avoid:** Deep mathematical formulations, bit-level manipulations, exhaustive pseudocode, specific programming language implementations, or highly detailed component breakdowns characteristic of a *technical specification* or *implementation guide*.

## 2. Core Principles Emphasis
   - Clearly explain the **purpose** of the topic (the problem it solves or its primary objective).
   - Describe its **core design strategy or operational philosophy** at a conceptual level, incorporating the fundamental technical elements identified above.
   - Explain the **key principles it embodies** (e.g., key-dependence, confusion, diffusion, standardization) or the **key challenges it addresses** conceptually.

## 3. Conceptual Explanation of Components
   - If applicable, describe the role of any **central controlling elements (e.g., keys) or critical structural components (e.g., round functions, S-boxes, key schedule)**.
   - Focus squarely on their **purpose, conceptual function, interaction, and influence within the overall design**, rather than detailing their precise internal construction or derivation algorithms.

## 4. Language and Tone
   - Use **clear, relatively simple, and intuitive language**.
   - Analogies may be helpful where appropriate to illustrate core concepts without oversimplifying.
   - Maintain an **academic-adjacent or technically informed introductory tone**, suitable for explaining foundational concepts accurately.

## 5. Structure and Flow
   - Present the framework **systematically** with coherent paragraphs.
   - Ensure a **logical flow** from introduction (purpose/context) through core strategy and principles to conclusion.
   - Use clear headings if appropriate to structure the document.

## 6. Depth vs. Breadth
   - Prioritize achieving **depth of conceptual understanding** regarding the topic's foundational ideas and core mechanisms.
   - **Avoid** attempting exhaustive technical coverage of every facet or variant.

## 7. Conclusion Requirements
   - Conclude with a **brief (approx. 5-6 handwritten lines or equivalent), impactful summary**.
   - Highlight the **significance, core design contribution, or fundamental value proposition** of the topic within its relevant context, potentially summarizing its key architectural elements conceptually.

# Output Format

The final document should read like a high-level, clear explanation focused on the **foundational ideas, guiding philosophy, and core conceptual mechanics** of the chosen topic, striking a balance between accessibility and informative technical grounding.

---

This revised prompt aims to be more explicit about allowing and explaining *essential* technical concepts conceptually, guiding the writer away from excessive abstraction while still firmly prohibiting deep implementation details, thus better targeting the kind of balanced output we achieved for DES.
