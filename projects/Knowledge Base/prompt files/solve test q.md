Examine the images carefully and identify any embedded questions. Solve them. There may be one or multiple questions present, and your task is to determine both what the questions are and how many there are. Ignore any marked answer options, as well as any repeated images. Do not consider images that are clearly not questions or that do not contribute to forming a question.
