I'll be uploading multiple files:

1. Template file(s) (either PDF, plain text converted from PDF, or text file)
2. Supplementary file(s) with domain-specific/technical information for the new topic

Among all files, at least the supplementary files are explicitly identified as such.

## Template Analysis Instructions

If the template is a PDF:
- Please directly analyze its structure, formatting, writing style, and organization

If the template is plain text converted from PDF:
- Carefully identify and infer the original document structure
- Look for patterns in spacing, numbering, and text formatting cues
- Understand that plain text converted from PDF often appears with irregular spacing, alignment issues, and disrupted formatting
- Recognize that paragraph breaks, indentation, and text flow may be distorted in the conversion process
- Be particularly careful with tables, columns, and formatted lists which often convert poorly
- Reconstruct the likely headings, sections, and hierarchical organization despite these limitations
- Identify where visual elements (tables, charts, callouts) were likely placed
- Determine formatting conventions (bold text, italics, etc.) from context clues even when formatting markers are missing

If the template is a text file:
- I may include brief descriptions about the document in `<note></note>` tags
- Identify and process these note tags correctly to understand document context
- Note that the text file may be sourced from multiple separate text files
- Each separate file will be explicitly identified as such to avoid confusion
- Analyze the structure, formatting, writing style, and organization as with other formats

## Content Creation Instructions

Then for any format:
1. Extract all relevant domain-specific information and terminology from the supplementary file(s)
2. Create a new document following the identified structure and style of the template(s)
3. Choose the correct level of technical depth:
   - Match the technical complexity level of the template document
   - Adjust terminology density based on the apparent target audience
   - Ensure technical concepts are explained at a level consistent with the template
   - Balance precision with accessibility appropriate to the document's purpose
4. Match both the depth and length/size of the template document:
   - Maintain similar section proportions and overall document length
   - Use comparable word count for equivalent sections
   - Include similar level of detail in explanations, examples, and illustrations
5. Use natural, simple, human-like language:
   - Write in a conversational tone that feels naturally human-written
   - Avoid overly perfect, mechanical, or AI-generated phrasing
   - Include occasional mild variations in style and structure
   - Maintain the human writing voice established in the template
6. Structure the generated document correctly:
   - Use proper Markdown formatting throughout
   - Create sections using appropriate heading levels (starting from level H1)
   - Maintain paragraph/essay style writing (not excessive bullet points)
   - Use cohesive paragraphs with topic sentences and supporting details
   - Only use bullet points where appropriate for the content type
7. Integrate the technical information appropriately throughout the document
8. Ask me clarifying questions for any information gaps
9. Note any structural elements you had to infer if working from plain text

Ignore files that explicitly identify themselves as dummy

Some additional info:
You will be genrating internship report document. I did internship in Ansys Electromagnetics. Here are what are covered in the course for your reference. Supplementary files have the techincal details (notes) for the course.
