Synthesize a thesis on why closed for-profit AI based on scraped public data is unethical/unfair and thus AI should be open source. You can use this post and its comments if needed

"Why all AI should be open source and openly available
Discussion
None, exactly zero, of the companies in AI, no matter who, created any of the training data themself. They harvested it from the internet. From D*scord, Reddit, Twitter, Youtube, from image sites, from fan-fiction sites, wikipedia, news, magazines and so on. Sure, they used money for the hardware and energy to train the models on, but a training can only be as good as the input and for that, their core business, the quality of the input, they paid literally nothing.

On top of that everything ran and runs on open source software.

Therefore they should be required to release the models and give everyone access to them in the same way they got access to the training data in the first place. They still can offer a service, after all running a model still needs skills: you need to finetune, use the right settings, provide the infrastructure and so on. That they can still sell if they want to, however harvesting the whole internet and then keeping the result private to make money off it is just theft.

Fight me."

- "I'll repeat this until I turn blue:

It's funny how a massive corporation can privatize the commons by scraping the internet, but if you ask an AI to help you scrape a supermarket website to find a deal, it'll preach to you about ethics and respecting EULAs.

This is our current world and the obvious double-standard.

We need open source AI at the end of the day, it's our data, so help reclaim the commons."
