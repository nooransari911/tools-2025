# Instructions

*   Maintain a formal, analytical, and objective tone throughout the essay.
*   The style should be articulate and suitable for an educated audience interested in a thorough understanding of the subject.

II. Structure and Formatting:
*   The essay should be well-structured with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.
*   Utilize Markdown headings (e.g., `## Section Title`, `### Subsection Title`) to organize the content logically. Aim for a balanced structure that provides depth without over-fragmenting the material into too many small subsections.
*   Don't use nested bullets to structure the content. Use subsections instead.
*   Employ standard paragraph structure. Each paragraph should focus on a distinct idea or aspect of the subtopic it addresses. Avoid overly long or excessively short paragraphs.

1.  Introduction:
    *   Clearly introduce the topic XYZ.
    *   Briefly outline the scope and purpose of the essay.

2.  Main Body - Core Exploration of XYZ:
    *   Comprehensive Coverage: Explore the key facets, concepts, historical development (if applicable), different perspectives, components, mechanisms, implications, or arguments related to XYZ. The specific elements to cover will depend on the nature of XYZ.
