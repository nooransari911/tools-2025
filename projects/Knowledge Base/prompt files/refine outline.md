base outline: PFA. 

# Changes you need to do:
here, I have modified the first 4 subsections from top manually.  you to similarly modify the rest of the outline.

- look at the "illusion of innovation and progress" subsection in I. here I have completely overhauled the flow and structure to be stronger, more direct and active, less obtuse.
- look at "false partnership" subsection in II. again here i have I have completely overhauled the flow and structure to be stronger, more direct and active, less obtuse.


# Instructions for structure and flow:
both the essay and outline must be:
- properly structured into sections using markdown headings
- avoid use of bold
- use paragraph/long from style for content;
- bullets must be used only where needed
- use simple natural human-like language (but no conversational tone);
- i expect it to be sharp, comprehensive, highly detailed and "technical" (in a sense).

You will be generating outline, not article.
