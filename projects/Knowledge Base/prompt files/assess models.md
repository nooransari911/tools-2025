Assess the performance of these models. Produce strictly only the assessment; don't output the input. Here are the details:



# Assessment Criteria for "Open-Source AI Ethics" Responses

1. Argument Construction and Coherence
   - Strength of the thesis connecting scraped public data to ethical concerns
   - Logical flow showing why privatizing common data is problematic
   - Clear connection between data acquisition methods and the argument for open-source AI
   - Critical evaluation of argument quality with differentiated assessment

2. Writing Style Adherence
   - Natural, simple, human-like language as requested
   - Appropriate balance of flowing prose with occasional structured elements where helpful
   - Balance of accessibility with depth and clarity
   - Accurate interpretation of style guidance

3. Ethical Analysis Quality
   - Thorough examination of the asymmetry between data collection and model ownership
   - Clear articulation of the "commons" concept and its privatization
   - Balanced treatment of stakeholder interests (public, companies, developers)
   - Identification of specific limitations even in strong responses

This approach requires:
- Using the full rating scale to meaningfully differentiate between responses
- Identifying specific strengths and weaknesses rather than providing general assessments
- Maintaining high standards for evaluation, even when assessing flagship models
- Providing concrete examples to justify ratings rather than defaulting to high scores
   
   
# Prompt given to all models:
Synthesize a thesis on why closed for-profit AI based on scraped public data is unethical/unfair and thus AI should be open source. You can use this post and its comments if needed

Write in natural, simple, human-like language while maintaining depth, quality and persuasive strength. Use flowing prose rather than bullet points mainly.

"Why all AI should be open source and openly available
Discussion
None, exactly zero, of the companies in AI, no matter who, created any of the training data themself. They harvested it from the internet. From D*scord, Reddit, Twitter, Youtube, from image sites, from fan-fiction sites, wikipedia, news, magazines and so on. Sure, they used money for the hardware and energy to train the models on, but a training can only be as good as the input and for that, their core business, the quality of the input, they paid literally nothing.

On top of that everything ran and runs on open source software.

Therefore they should be required to release the models and give everyone access to them in the same way they got access to the training data in the first place. They still can offer a service, after all running a model still needs skills: you need to finetune, use the right settings, provide the infrastructure and so on. That they can still sell if they want to, however harvesting the whole internet and then keeping the result private to make money off it is just theft.

Fight me."

- "I'll repeat this until I turn blue:

It's funny how a massive corporation can privatize the commons by scraping the internet, but if you ask an AI to help you scrape a supermarket website to find a deal, it'll preach to you about ethics and respecting EULAs.

This is our current world and the obvious double-standard.

We need open source AI at the end of the day, it's our data, so help reclaim the commons."

        "Response": string  (response generated by the model)
