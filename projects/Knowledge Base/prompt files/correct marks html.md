add option to edit main question number. main ques number should be simple form
field with rename/edit option. now calculate total best case, worst marks as
well in addition to total likely mark. add new input : weight for worst case
assuming weight for best case is 1. this is used for the weighted averaging.
there is a ghost extra purple line at the top main box at homepage. fix it add
navbar at side that shows all questions as tree. support easy navigation from
there, collapsing questions, resizing width, etc, essentially a modern fully
featured sidebar. move the main buttons (add ques, export, calculate, etc.) to
the sidebar. input fields for marks put input value number at too much left,
meaning they are almost on the border of field box. optimize it each diagram,
introduction, explanation/operation/details, graph get separate marks. its not a
checkbox like here, its evaluation criteria. also remove "up-down" arrows in all
text input fields
