# Question, briefly
Which of the following is NOT a requirement for solving the critical section problem?

# Answer
a) Starvation

# Explanation
The critical section problem requires three essential conditions to be satisfied for a correct solution:

- **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process can execute in the critical section at a time.
- **Progress**: If no process is in the critical section and some processes wish to enter, the selection of the next process cannot be postponed indefinitely.
- **Bounded Waiting**: There must be a limit on how many times other processes are allowed to enter the critical section after a process has made a request.

Starvation, however, is not a requirement but rather a problem that occurs when a process is perpetually denied access to the critical section. Thus, it is the correct answer as the option that is NOT a requirement.
