# Questions
## Number of Spanning Trees
Find the number of spanning trees in the following graph.
a) 25
b) 20
c) 9
d) 19

## Designing REST APIs
Which of the following are best practices in designing a RESTful API?
a) The API should not be loosely coupled.
b) The API should not store the client state on the server.
c) 400 - level error codes can represent errors on both the client side and server side.
d) The 404 error code generally refers to a 'NOT FOUND' error.

## In-Context Gradient Update
In sentiment classification using a non-fine-tuned large language model prompted with examples, which of the following statements is correct about gradient updates in in-context learning?
a) The gradient is not calculated.
b) The gradient is calculated, but the LLM weights are not updated through back-propagation.
c) The gradient is calculated and the LLM weights are updated through back-propagation.

## Identify Bottlenecks and Handle Peak Loads
A fintech startup is launching a mobile payment app that will allow users to make transactions, track spending, and manage finances and needs performance testing in the cloud. They want to identify bottlenecks, ensure the app handles peak loads, and deliver a smooth user experience under various network conditions. Testing should also optimize performance, guarantee security, and ensure scalability. Which approach accomplishes these goals?
a) Conduct manual testing by having a group of beta users try out the app under different conditions, use their feedback to identify issues without quantitative measurement, perform occasional stress tests without specific tools, and focus primarily on functional testing over performance and scalability.
b) Limit testing to low traffic scenarios to ensure a smooth user experience in controlled conditions, manually check app responsiveness on different devices, avoid stress testing to prevent potential disruptions, and conduct security audits separately, without integrating them into performance testing.
c) Use a single tool for all types of performance testing to simplify the process. Focus on testing only the most critical features under peak load.
d) Use tools like Apache Jmeter or LoadRunner for load and stress testing, simulate user behavior from different geographies to test scalability and latency, integrate performance testing with security testing tools like OWASP ZAP for holistic testing, and use cloud monitoring tools to track performance metrics and identify bottlenecks in real time.
