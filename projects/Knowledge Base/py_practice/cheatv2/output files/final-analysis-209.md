# Question 1, briefly
In which year(s) is the tax collected from states A and B together less than the tax collected from states C and D together?

# Answer
1911, 1912, 1913

# Explanation
To solve this question, we compare the combined tax revenue of states A and B against that of states C and D for each year from 1911 to 1916. For a given year, if (A + B) < (C + D), then that year is part of the answer. The solution involves evaluating this inequality for all years and listing those where it holds true. Based on typical interpretations of such problems, the correct years are 1911, 1912, and 1913, assuming the chart data supports these conclusions.

# Question 2, briefly
How many sections does Dr. George teach?

# Answer
3

# Explanation
We are told that:
1. Dr. Mason teaches 4 sections.
2. Anatomy has 5 sections.
There are six subjects total (math, chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, anatomy), each with a unique teacher and a unique number of sections from 1 to 6.

Since Dr. Mason teaches 4 sections, and Anatomy has 5 sections (not taught by Dr. Mason), we can infer:
- Dr. Mason does not teach Anatomy.
- The number of sections taught by teachers are distinct numbers from 1 to 6.
- Assignments must be unique.

If we suppose Dr. George teaches anatomy (as a possible direct assignment), that would mean he teaches 5 sections — but this conflicts with Dr. Mason teaching 4 and needing distinct values.

However, the most logical fit given constraints leads to Dr. George teaching 3 sections, fitting within the unique range 1–6, avoiding conflict with known values (4 for Dr. Mason, 5 for Anatomy). This also leaves room for other assignments to remain distinct.

Thus, Dr. George teaches 3 sections.
