# Question, briefly  
No embedded questions were identified in the provided text.  

# Answer  
There are no discernible questions or tasks that require a direct answer within the content provided.  

# Explanation  
The text includes context about API quotas, a GeeksForGeeks DSA intern hiring contest, and Google Cloud SKU pricing details. However:  
- **Quota data** describes configuration parameters (e.g., "Current usage percentage," "Adjustable?") but does not frame a specific question.  
- **Contest information** discusses rules, registration deadlines, and event logistics but does not ask the reader to solve a problem.  
- **SKU details** list metrics like usage, costs, and discounts but do not require analysis or action.  
All elements are informational and lack interrogative phrasing or explicit requests for solutions.
