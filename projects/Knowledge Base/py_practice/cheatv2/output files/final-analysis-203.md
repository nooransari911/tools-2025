# Question, briefly
Find the number of spanning trees in the given graph.

# Answer
The question cannot be answered without the graph.

# Explanation
Spanning tree count depends entirely on the structure of the graph. Common methods include Kirchhoff's theorem (using the Laplacian matrix) or manual enumeration for small graphs. However, since the graph is not provided in the prompt, the question cannot be solved.

# Question, briefly
Which are best practices in designing a RESTful API?

# Answer
b) The API should not store the client state on the server.  
d) The 404 error code generally refers to a 'NOT FOUND' error.

# Explanation
- REST APIs follow a stateless model, meaning each client request must contain all necessary information for the server to process it. The server should not maintain client state (b is correct).
- HTTP 404 status code explicitly means "Not Found", indicating the requested resource does not exist (d is correct).
- a) is incorrect because loose coupling is actually a best practice in REST design.
- c) is incorrect because 400-level HTTP codes represent client-side errors, not server-side issues.

# Question, briefly
Which statement is correct about gradient updates in in-context learning for sentiment classification using a non-fine-tuned LLM?

# Answer
a) The gradient is not calculated.

# Explanation
In in-context learning with non-fine-tuned LLMs, the model parameters are frozen, and no training (i.e., gradient calculation or backpropagation) occurs. The model relies purely on provided examples within the prompt to influence its predictions. As a result, gradients are not computed or used to update weights.

# Question, briefly
Which approach best accomplishes performance, scalability, security, and bottleneck identification goals for a fintech app's cloud-based testing?

# Answer
d) Use tools like Apache JMeter or LoadRunner for load and stress testing, simulate user behavior from different geographies to test scalability and latency, integrate performance testing with security testing tools like OWASP ZAP for holistic testing, and use cloud monitoring tools to track performance metrics and identify bottlenecks in real time.

# Explanation
- Option (d) provides a comprehensive and systematic method for performance and scalability testing.
- It uses industry-standard tools for load/stress testing and supports global user simulation.
- Integrating performance and security testing ensures both areas are covered holistically.
- Real-time cloud monitoring enables effective bottleneck detection.
- Other options have significant drawbacks:
  - (a) lacks quantitative measurement and focuses on functional rather than performance testing.
  - (b) avoids stress testing and limits scope to low traffic.
  - (c) assumes a single-tool solution and omits many important features from testing.
