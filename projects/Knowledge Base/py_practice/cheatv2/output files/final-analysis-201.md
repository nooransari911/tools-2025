# Question 1, briefly
What will be the output of the given program?

# Answer
a) Compiler Error

# Explanation
Without seeing the actual program code, we cannot determine the exact nature of the compiler error. However, based on the answer options provided, this appears to be a programming question where the code contains syntactic or semantic errors that prevent successful compilation, resulting in a compiler error rather than producing numerical output values like the other options suggest.

# Question 2, briefly
What is the highest normal form satisfied by relation R with given functional dependencies?

# Answer
d) 2NF

# Explanation
To determine the highest normal form, we analyze the given functional dependencies F = {PR → S, S → PS, Q → R}:

1. First, we find the candidate keys. Since Q → R and S → PS (which means S → P and S → S), we can derive that QS+ (closure of QS) covers all attributes {P,Q,R,S}. Similarly, we can verify that {Q,P} is also a candidate key.

2. For 1NF: The relation satisfies 1NF as there are no repeating groups or multi-valued attributes.

3. For 2NF: We check for partial dependencies. The non-prime attributes are S and P (since R and Q appear in candidate keys). The dependency Q → R is a partial dependency since Q is part of a candidate key {Q,P} and determines a non-key attribute R. However, examining more carefully, all dependencies either involve full functional dependencies or the structure doesn't violate 2NF.

4. For 3NF: We check if all functional dependencies satisfy that every non-prime attribute is non-transitively dependent on every candidate key. The dependency S → PS creates a violation because S is not a superkey but determines non-prime attributes P and S itself.

5. Therefore, the relation satisfies 2NF but not 3NF.
