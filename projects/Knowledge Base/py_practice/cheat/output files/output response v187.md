# Question, briefly
Why does a form field show `[object Object]`?

# Question
The "Additional Information" field in the GeeksforGeeks contest registration form displays the text `[object Object]`. Why is this happening?

# Answer
This is a common issue in web development that occurs when a JavaScript object is improperly rendered as a string. The code is assigning a complete object to the value of the text input field, instead of assigning a specific property from that object. When a standard JavaScript object is converted to a string, it defaults to the literal text `"[object Object]"`.

# Explanation
HTML input elements are designed to display string values. When a developer attempts to set the `value` of an input field to a complex data type like a JavaScript object, the JavaScript engine performs type coercion to convert the object into a string.

For a generic object that does not have a custom `toString()` method, this conversion results in the string `"[object Object]"`.

The bug indicates that the application's code is likely doing something similar to this:

```javascript
// Incorrect code
const userInfo = {
    name: 'Noor Ansari',
    contact: '1234567890',
    additionalInfo: 'Some details here' 
    // This property should have been used, but the whole object was passed instead.
};

const inputField = document.querySelector('input[name="additional_information"]');
inputField.value = userInfo; // This causes the input to display "[object Object]"
```

To fix this, the developer should have accessed the specific property within the object that contains the additional information and assigned that string to the input's value.

```javascript
// Correct code
inputField.value = userInfo.additionalInfo; // This would display "Some details here"
```

# Question, briefly
Why is there a cost discrepancy for Gemini API usage?

# Question
A billing report for the Gemini API shows two distinct costs for what appears to be the same service. One line item is ₹86.78 for 101,659 tokens, while another is ₹1.25 for 11,756 tokens. What is the reason for this significant difference in cost per token?

# Answer
The cost difference is because the two line items are for different types of tokens: "input tokens" and "output tokens". It is standard practice for AI and large language model (LLM) providers to price input and output tokens differently. Output tokens are significantly more expensive because generating content is more computationally intensive than processing the input prompt.

# Explanation
The billing statement breaks down the usage and cost for two separate SKUs (Stock Keeping Units):
1.  **Generate content output token count**: This line item tracks the tokens generated by the Gemini model as a response.
    - Usage: 101,659 tokens
    - Cost: ₹86.78
    - Cost per token: ₹86.78 / 101,659 ≈ ₹0.00085 per token

2.  **Generate content input token count**: This line item tracks the tokens that make up the prompt sent to the model.
    - Usage: 11,756 tokens
    - Cost: ₹1.25
    - Cost per token: ₹1.25 / 11,756 ≈ ₹0.00011 per token

The cost of generating output is approximately 8 times higher than the cost of processing input in this example. This pricing structure reflects the underlying computational load. Processing an input prompt primarily involves reading and understanding the text, while generating an output requires the model to perform complex calculations to predict and form a coherent and relevant sequence of new tokens. This generation process consumes far more computing resources, leading to a higher price.
