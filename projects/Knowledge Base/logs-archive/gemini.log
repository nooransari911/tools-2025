Your task is to rewrite the answer to address all of these issues and create a high-quality response. The rewritten answer must be in the following format: # Q.1 A: <question> <rewritten answer>. The rewritten answer must: 1. Directly and completely answer the question. Ensure that the answer addresses all aspects of the question and leaves no room for ambiguity. 2. Be factually accurate. Verify all information and correct any errors. Use reliable sources if necessary. 3. Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the topic. Provide in-depth explanations and relevant details. 4. Be written in simple, clear language. Avoid jargon and technical terms whenever possible. If technical terms are necessary, define them clearly. 5. Have a logical flow and high clarity. Organize the answer in a way that is easy to follow and understand. Use headings, bullet points, or other formatting elements to improve readability. Focus on providing the best possible answer for a student preparing for a theory exam.
