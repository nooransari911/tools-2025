An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.\\nA *computational problem* specifies the desired input/output relationship. An *instance of a problem* consists of the input (satisfying constraints in the problem statement) needed to compute a solution.\\nAn algorithm is *correct* if, for every problem instance provided as input, it halts with the correct output.\\nA *data structure* is a way to store and organize data to facilitate access and modifications. No single data structure works well for all purposes.\\n\\n## 1.2 Problem Types\\nAlgorithms solve diverse problems, including sorting, searching, graph problems (shortest paths, topological sort), numerical problems (matrix multiplication, FFT), and problems in areas like computational biology, cryptography, and resource allocation (linear programming).\\n*Hard problems*, such as NP-complete problems (e.g., traveling-salesperson problem), are those for which no known efficient algorithm exists. For these, approximation algorithms are often sought.\\n\\n# 2 Chapter 2: Getting Started\\n\\n## 2.1 Incremental Method\\nExample: *Insertion sort*. It sorts an array by iteratively taking an element from the unsorted part and inserting it into its correct position in the already sorted part.\\n\\n## 2.2 Loop Invariants\\nA tool to prove algorithm correctness. For a loop invariant, three properties must be shown:\\n- *Initialization*: It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop.\\n- *Maintenance*: If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration.\\n- *Termination*: When the loop terminates, the invariant (usually along with the reason for termination) gives a useful property that helps show the algorithm is correct.\\n\\n## 2.3 Analyzing Algorithms\\n*Input size* ($n$) depends on the problem (e.g., number of items for sorting, total bits for multiplying integers).\\n*Running time* $T(n)$ is the number of primitive operations or \\\"steps\\\" executed on a particular input of size $n$. Assumed model is a generic one-processor, *random-access machine (RAM)* model where instructions execute sequentially and basic operations take constant time.\\n\\n### 2.3.1 Analysis Types\\n- *Worst-case analysis*: Longest running time for any input of size $n$. Provides an upper bound and is often the focus because it's a guarantee, the worst case occurs often for some problems, and the average case is frequently as bad as the worst case.\\n- *Average-case analysis*: Expected running time over all inputs of size $n$, assuming a certain probability distribution of inputs.\\n- *Order of growth*: Focuses on the leading term of the running time formula and ignores constant coefficients, as it best characterizes efficiency for large inputs.\\n\\n## 2.4 Divide-and-Conquer Method\\nA common recursive algorithm design technique:\\n- *Divide* the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.\\n- *Conquer* the subproblems by solving them recursively. If subproblem sizes are small enough (base case), solve them directly.\\n- *Combine* the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.\\nExample: *Merge sort*. Sorts an array $A[p..r]$ by:\\n1.  Divide: If $p<r$, find index $q = \\\\lfloor(p+r)/2\\\\rfloor$ to split $A[p..r]$ into $A[p..q]$ and $A[q+1..r]$.\\n2.  Conquer: Recursively sort $A[p..q]$ and $A[q+1..r]$ using merge sort.\\n3.  Combine: Merge the two sorted subarrays $A[p..q]$ and $A[q+1..r]$ to produce a single sorted subarray $A[p..r]$. The MERGE procedure takes $\\\\Theta(n)$ time for $n$ elements.\\n\\n### 2.4.1 Recurrence Relations for Divide-and-Conquer\\nThe running time $T(n)$ of a divide-and-conquer algorithm is often described by a recurrence. For merge sort:\\n$T(n) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\Theta(1) & \\\\text{if } n=1 \\\\\\\\ 2T(n/2) + \\\\Theta(n) & \\\\text{if } n > 1 \\\\end{cases}$\\nThis recurrence solves to $T(n) = \\\\Theta(n \\\\lg n)$.\\n\\n# 3 Chapter 3: Characterizing Running Times\\n\\n## 3.1 Asymptotic Notation\\nUsed to describe the behavior of functions in the limit, focusing on order of growth.\\n\\n### 3.1.1 $\\\\Theta$-notation (Theta-notation)\\nDefines an asymptotically tight bound.\\n$\\\\Theta(g(n)) = \\\\{f(n) : \\\\text{there exist positive constants } c_1, c_2, \\\\text{ and } n_0 \\\\text{ such that } 0 \\\\le c_1 g(n) \\\\le f(n) \\\\le c_2 g(n) \\\\text{ for all } n \\\\ge n_0\\\\}$.\\n\\n### 3.1.2 $O$-notation (Big-O notation)\\nDefines an asymptotic upper bound.\\n$O(g(n)) = \\\\{f(n) : \\\\text{there exist positive constants } c \\\\text{ and } n_0 \\\\text{ such that } 0 \\\\le f(n) \\\\le c g(n) \\\\text{ for all } n \\\\ge n_0\\\\}$.\\n\\n### 3.1.3 $\\\\Omega$-notation (Big-Omega notation)\\nDefines an asymptotic lower bound.\\n$\\\\Omega(g(n)) = \\\\{f(n) : \\\\text{there exist positive constants } c \\\\text{ and } n_0 \\\\text{ such that } 0 \\\\le c g(n) \\\\le f(n) \\\\text{ for all } n \\\\ge n_0\\\\}$.\\n\\n### 3.1.4 $o$-notation (Little-o notation)\\nDefines an upper bound that is not asymptotically tight.\\n$o(g(n)) = \\\\{f(n) : \\\\text{for any positive constant } c > 0, \\\\text{ there exists a constant } n_0 > 0 \\\\text{ such that } 0 \\\\le f(n) < c g(n) \\\\text{ for all } n \\\\ge n_0\\\\}$.\\nEquivalently, $\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 0$.\\n\\n### 3.1.5 $\\\\omega$-notation (Little-omega notation)\\nDefines a lower bound that is not asymptotically tight.\\n$\\\\omega(g(n)) = \\\\{f(n) : \\\\text{for any positive constant } c > 0, \\\\text{ there exists a constant } n_0 > 0 \\\\text{ such that } 0 \\\\le c g(n) < f(n) \\\\text{ for all } n \\\\ge n_0\\\\}$.\\nEquivalently, $\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = \\\\infty$.\\n\\n# 4 Chapter 4: Divide-and-Conquer (Overview based on Part I Introduction)\\nChapter 4 delves further into the divide-and-conquer method, providing additional examples such as Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication. It also covers methods for solving recurrences, including the substitution method, the recursion-tree method, and the master method for solving recurrences of the form $T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)$.\\n\\n# 5 Chapter 5: Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms (Overview based on Part I Introduction)\\nChapter 5 introduces probabilistic analysis, used to determine an algorithm's running time when it may differ on inputs of the same size due to an inherent probability distribution (either in the inputs or from random choices made by the algorithm). Randomized algorithms use a random-number generator to make choices. This chapter explores concepts such as indicator random variables. Example applications include the hiring problem (analysis shows an expected hiring cost of $\\\\Theta(c_h \\\\ln n)$), the birthday paradox, and balls and bins problems.

An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.\\nAn algorithm can also be viewed as a tool for solving a well-specified *computational problem*. The problem statement specifies the desired input/output relationship. For example, the *sorting problem* is:\\n- Input: A sequence of $n$ numbers $(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$.\\n- Output: A permutation (reordering) $(a'_1, a'_2, ..., a'_n)$ of the input sequence such that $a'_1 \\\\le a'_2 \\\\le ... \\\\le a'_n$.\\nAn *instance of a problem* consists of the input (satisfying constraints imposed in the problem statement) needed to compute a solution to the problem.\\nAn algorithm is *correct* if, for every problem instance provided as input, it halts and outputs the correct solution. An incorrect algorithm might not halt or might halt with an incorrect answer.\\nAlgorithms can be specified in English, as a computer program, or as a hardware design.\\n\\n### 1.1.1 What kinds of problems are solved by algorithms?\\nAlgorithms are used in a vast array of practical applications:\\n- The Human Genome Project uses algorithms for gene identification, sequence determination, data storage, and analysis (e.g., dynamic programming for sequence similarity).\\n- The internet relies on algorithms for routing data (e.g., shortest path algorithms) and for search engines to find information.\\n- Electronic commerce depends on algorithms for privacy and security, such as public-key cryptography and digital signatures, based on numerical algorithms and number theory.\\n- Manufacturing and commercial enterprises use algorithms for resource allocation, often modeled as linear programs.\\n\\nSpecific problems solved by algorithms include:\\n- Finding the shortest path in a graph (modeling road maps or networks).\\n- Topological sorting (ordering parts in a mechanical design or tasks with dependencies).\\n- Clustering algorithms (e.g., determining if a medical image represents a cancerous tumor by comparing similarity to known examples).\\n- Data compression (e.g., Huffman coding).\\nThese problems often have many candidate solutions, making efficient search for the best solution challenging. They also have significant practical applications.\\nSome problems, like the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), don't have an easily identified set of candidate solutions but are crucial in signal processing and data compression.\\n\\n### 1.1.2 Data structures\\nA *data structure* is a way to store and organize data to facilitate access and modifications. Choosing appropriate data structures is an important part of algorithm design, as no single data structure is optimal for all purposes.\\n\\n### 1.1.3 Technique\\nThis book teaches techniques for algorithm design and analysis, enabling development of new algorithms, proving their correctness, and analyzing their efficiency. Techniques include divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and amortized analysis.\\n\\n### 1.1.4 Hard problems\\nSome problems, known as *NP-complete* problems, have no known efficient algorithm. For these:\\n- No efficient algorithm has been found, nor has it been proven that one cannot exist.\\n- If an efficient algorithm exists for one NP-complete problem, then efficient algorithms exist for all of them.\\n- They are often similar to problems with known efficient solutions.\\nIf a problem is NP-complete, effort may be better spent developing an *approximation algorithm* that finds a good, but not necessarily optimal, solution. The *traveling-salesperson problem* is a classic example.\\n\\n### 1.1.5 Alternative computing models\\n- *Parallel computing*: Multicore processors require algorithms designed for parallelism (e.g., task-parallel algorithms) to achieve best performance.\\n- *Online algorithms*: Handle input that arrives over time, requiring decisions without full knowledge of future input (e.g., scheduling in data centers, routing in networks, triage in emergency rooms).\\n\\n## 1.2 Algorithms as a technology\\nAlgorithm efficiency is crucial. Even with fast computers, an inefficient algorithm can be impractical for large inputs. For example, an algorithm with $\\\\Theta(n^2)$ running time (like insertion sort) is significantly outperformed by an algorithm with $\\\\Theta(n \\\\lg n)$ running time (like merge sort) for large $n$, regardless of constant factors or hardware speed.\\nChoosing efficient algorithms is as important as choosing fast hardware for total system performance. Advances in algorithms are as impactful as advances in other computer technologies.\\nAlgorithms are fundamental even in applications that might not seem overtly algorithmic at the application level, as they underpin hardware design, GUIs, networking, compilers, and machine learning.\\nMachine learning itself is a collection of algorithms. While it automates algorithmic design for some problems (especially where human understanding of the ideal algorithm is limited, like computer vision), for many well-understood problems, specifically designed efficient algorithms are typically more successful. Data science also heavily relies on the design and analysis of algorithms.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"file\": \"PartI Foundations/C2 Getting Started.md\",\n                \"contents\": \"# 2 Getting Started\\n\\nThis chapter introduces a framework for thinking about algorithm design and analysis, focusing on insertion sort and merge sort.\\n\\n## 2.1 Insertion sort\\nInsertion sort is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements. It solves the sorting problem:\\n- Input: A sequence of $n$ numbers $(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$, also known as *keys*.\\n- Output: A permutation $(a'_1, a'_2, ..., a'_n)$ such that $a'_1 \\\\le a'_2 \\\\le ... \\\\le a'_n$.\\nKeys are often associated with *satellite data*, forming a *record*. Sorting usually moves records with their keys.\\nInsertion sort works like sorting a hand of playing cards: take cards one by one from a pile and insert them into the correct position in your left hand. The left hand always holds sorted cards.\\nThe pseudocode for insertion sort is [[PartI Foundations Algorithms.md#2.1 INSERTION-SORT]]. It sorts an array $A[1..n]$ in place.\\n\\n### 2.1.1 Loop invariants and the correctness of insertion sort\\nA *loop invariant* is a property that holds true before each iteration of a loop. To show correctness using a loop invariant, we demonstrate three things:\\n- *Initialization*: The invariant is true prior to the first loop iteration.\\n- *Maintenance*: If the invariant is true before an iteration, it remains true before the next iteration.\\n- *Termination*: When the loop terminates, the invariant, combined with the termination condition, helps prove the algorithm's correctness.\\n\\nFor INSERTION-SORT (lines 1-8 of [[PartI Foundations Algorithms.md#2.1 INSERTION-SORT]]):\\n- *Loop Invariant*: At the start of each iteration of the `for` loop (indexed by `i`), the subarray $A[1..i-1]$ consists of the elements originally in $A[1..i-1]$, but in sorted order.\\n- *Initialization*: Before the first iteration ($i=2$), $A[1..i-1]$ is $A[1]$. This single-element subarray is the original element $A[1]$ and is trivially sorted. The invariant holds.\\n- *Maintenance*: The body of the `for` loop (lines 2-8) works by moving $A[i-1], A[i-2], \\text{etc.,}$ one position to the right until the correct position for `key` (original $A[i]$) is found. Then `key` is inserted. This ensures $A[1..i]$ now contains original elements from $A[1..i]$ in sorted order. Incrementing $i$ for the next iteration then maintains the invariant for the new $A[1..i-1]$. (A more formal proof would use a nested loop invariant for the `while` loop of lines 5-7).\\n- *Termination*: The `for` loop terminates when $i$ exceeds $n$, so $i=n+1$. Substituting $n+1$ for $i$ in the invariant, the subarray $A[1..n]$ consists of the elements originally in $A[1..n]$, but in sorted order. This means the entire array is sorted.\\n\\n### 2.1.2 Pseudocode conventions\\n- Indentation indicates block structure.\\n- Looping constructs (`while`, `for`, `repeat-until`) and conditionals (`if-else`) are similar to C, Java, Python. Loop counters retain their value after exiting a `for` loop (value that exceeded the bound).\\n- `//` denotes a comment.\\n- Variables are local to the procedure unless specified.\\n- Array elements are accessed via `A[i]`. 1-origin indexing is common, but bounds are specified if ambiguous. `A[i..j]` denotes a subarray.\\n- Compound data is organized into objects with attributes, accessed via `object.attribute`.\\n- Variables for arrays/objects are treated as pointers/references. Assignment copies the reference, not the object. Changes to attributes via one reference are visible via others pointing to the same object.\\n- Parameters are passed *by value*. For objects/arrays, the reference is passed by value; the called procedure gets a copy of the reference. Modifying array elements or object attributes *is* visible to the caller.\\n- `return` statement transfers control and optionally a value. Multiple values can be returned.\\n- Boolean operators `and` and `or` are short-circuiting.\\n- `error` keyword indicates an unrecoverable error, terminating the procedure.\\n\\n## 2.2 Analyzing algorithms\\nAnalyzing an algorithm means predicting the resources it requires, typically computational time. This is done using a computational model, usually the *random-access machine (RAM)* model. In the RAM model:\\n- Instructions execute one after another (no concurrency).\\n- Basic instructions (arithmetic, data movement, control) take a constant amount of time.\\n- Data types are integers, floating-point numbers, characters. Word size is assumed to be constant (e.g., $c \\\\lg n$ bits for input size $n$).\\nThis model doesn't account for memory hierarchy (caches, virtual memory) but is often a good predictor of performance.\\n\\n### 2.2.1 Analysis of insertion sort\\nLet $c_k$ be the cost of line $k$. Let $t_i$ be the number of times the `while` loop test in line 5 is executed for a given $i$.\\nThe running time $T(n)$ of INSERTION-SORT is:\\n$T(n) = c_1 n + c_2(n-1) + c_4(n-1) + c_5 \\\\sum_{i=2}^{n} t_i + c_6 \\\\sum_{i=2}^{n} (t_i-1) + c_7 \\\\sum_{i=2}^{n} (t_i-1) + c_8(n-1)$.\\n\\n- *Best case*: Array is already sorted. $t_i=1$ for all $i=2,...,n$. The `while` loop condition fails immediately.\\n$T(n) = (c_1+c_2+c_4+c_5+c_8)n - (c_2+c_4+c_5+c_8)$. This is a linear function of $n$, so $T(n) = \\\\Theta(n)$.\\n\\n- *Worst case*: Array is in reverse sorted order. The `while` loop must compare `key` with every element in $A[1..i-1]$. So $t_i=i$ for $i=2,...,n$.\\n$\\\\sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1$.\\n$\\\\sum_{i=2}^{n} (i-1) = \\\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\\n$T(n) = (\\\\frac{c_5}{2}+\\\\frac{c_6}{2}+\\\\frac{c_7}{2})n^2 + (c_1+c_2+c_4+\\\\frac{c_5}{2}-\\\\frac{c_6}{2}-\\\\frac{c_7}{2}+c_8)n - (c_2+c_4+c_5+c_8)$.\\nThis is a quadratic function of $n$, so $T(n) = \\\\Theta(n^2)$.\\n\\n### 2.2.2 Worst-case and average-case analysis\\n- *Worst-case running time*: Longest time for any input of size $n$. Provides an upper bound. Important for guarantees and real-time systems.\\n- *Average-case running time*: Expected time over all inputs of size $n$, assuming a probability distribution. Often, the average case is roughly as bad as the worst case (e.g., for insertion sort, it's also $\\\\Theta(n^2)$ if all permutations are equally likely).\\n\\n### 2.2.3 Order of growth\\nThe rate of growth, or *order of growth*, is the primary concern. We focus on the leading term of the formula (e.g., $an^2$ from $an^2+bn+c$) and ignore the constant coefficient $a$. This abstraction is captured by asymptotic notation (e.g., $\\\\Theta(n^2)$).\\nAn algorithm with a lower order of growth is generally more efficient for large inputs.\\n\\n## 2.3 Designing algorithms\\n\\n### 2.3.1 The divide-and-conquer method\\nMany algorithms are recursive. Divide-and-conquer is a common approach:\\n1.  *Divide*: Break the problem into several subproblems that are similar to the original but smaller.\\n2.  *Conquer*: Solve the subproblems recursively. If subproblems are small enough (base case), solve directly.\\n3.  *Combine*: Merge the solutions of subproblems to create the solution for the original problem.\\n\\n*Merge Sort* algorithm follows this paradigm to sort a subarray $A[p..r]$:\\n- *Divide*: If $p < r$, calculate $q = \\\\lfloor (p+r)/2 \\\\rfloor$. Divide $A[p..r]$ into $A[p..q]$ and $A[q+1..r]$.\\n- *Conquer*: Recursively sort $A[p..q]$ and $A[q+1..r]$ using [[PartI Foundations Algorithms.md#2.3 MERGE-SORT]]. The base case is when $p \\\\ge r$ (subarray has 0 or 1 element, which is already sorted).\\n- *Combine*: Merge the two sorted subarrays $A[p..q]$ and $A[q+1..r]$ into a single sorted subarray $A[p..r]$ using the auxiliary procedure [[PartI Foundations Algorithms.md#2.3 MERGE]]. The MERGE procedure takes two sorted piles of cards (subarrays) and merges them into a single sorted output pile. It copies $A[p..q]$ to $L$ and $A[q+1..r]$ to $R$, then iteratively picks the smaller of $L[i]$ and $R[j]$ to place into $A[k]$, advancing appropriate indices. This takes $\\\\Theta(n)$ time for $n = r-p+1$ elements.\\n\\n### 2.3.2 Analyzing divide-and-conquer algorithms\\nRunning time is often described by a *recurrence equation*. For merge sort, sorting $n$ numbers:\\n- *Divide*: Computing $q$ takes constant time, $\\\\Theta(1)$.\\n- *Conquer*: Recursively solving two subproblems of size $n/2$ (approx.) takes $2T(n/2)$ time.\\n- *Combine*: Merging $n$ elements takes $\\\\Theta(n)$ time.\\nSo, the recurrence is $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \\\\Theta(n)$. The base case is $T(n) = \\\\Theta(1)$ for small $n$ (e.g., $n=1$).\\n\\nThis recurrence can be solved using a *recursion tree*. For $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + cn$ (assuming $n$ is a power of 2 for simplicity):\\n- Level 0 (root): cost $cn$.\\n- Level 1: 2 nodes, each $T(n/2)$, cost $c(n/2)$ each. Total cost $2 \\\\cdot c(n/2) = cn$.\\n- Level $i$: $2^i$ nodes, each problem size $n/2^i$, cost $c(n/2^i)$ each. Total cost $2^i \\\\cdot c(n/2^i) = cn$.\\n- Last level (leaves): $n$ nodes (when problem size is 1), level $\\\\lg n$. Cost per node $T(1)=\\\\Theta(1)$ (say $c_1$). Total cost $c_1 n$.\\nThere are $\\\\lg n + 1$ levels. Total cost is sum of costs at each level: $(\\\\lg n) \\\\cdot cn + c_1 n = cn \\\\lg n + c_1 n = \\\\Theta(n \\\\lg n)$.\\nMerge sort's worst-case running time is $\\\\Theta(n \\\\lg n)$, significantly better than insertion sort's $\\\\Theta(n^2)$.\\n\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"file\": \"PartI Foundations/C3 Characterizing Running Times.md\",\n                \"contents\": \"# 3 Characterizing Running Times\\n\\nThis chapter formally defines asymptotic notations used to characterize the order of growth of algorithm running times, simplifying analysis by focusing on behavior for large inputs.\\n\\n## 3.1 O-notation, $\\\\Omega$-notation, and $\\\\Theta$-notation (Informal Introduction)\\nWhen analyzing insertion sort's worst-case running time, we derived a complex expression $an^2+bn+c$. We simplified this by discarding lower-order terms ($bn, c$) and the leading coefficient ($a$), resulting in $\\\\Theta(n^2)$.\\n\\n- *O-notation* ($O$): Describes an upper bound. A function $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ if $f(n)$ grows no faster than $g(n)$ (e.g., $7n^3+100n^2-20n+6$ is $O(n^3)$, also $O(n^4)$).\\n- *$\\\\Omega$-notation* ($\\\\Omega$): Describes a lower bound. $f(n)$ is $\\\\Omega(g(n))$ if $f(n)$ grows at least as fast as $g(n)$ (e.g., $7n^3+100n^2-20n+6$ is $\\\\Omega(n^3)$, also $\\\\Omega(n^2)$).\\n- *$\\\\Theta$-notation* ($\\\\Theta$): Describes a tight bound. $f(n)$ is $\\\\Theta(g(n))$ if $f(n)$ grows at the same rate as $g(n)$, up to constant factors (e.g., $7n^3+100n^2-20n+6$ is $\\\\Theta(n^3)$). $f(n)=\\\\Theta(g(n))$ if $f(n)=O(g(n))$ and $f(n)=\\\\Omega(g(n))$.\\n\\nExample: Insertion sort. Worst-case running time is $\\\\Theta(n^2)$. The outer `for` loop runs $n-1$ times. The inner `while` loop can run up to $i-1$ times for each $i$. So, total operations are $O(n^2)$. For a worst-case input (e.g., reverse sorted, first $n/3$ elements are the largest $n/3$), elements must move significantly, leading to $\\\\Omega(n^2)$ operations. Thus, worst-case is $\\\\Theta(n^2)$. Best-case is $\\\\Theta(n)$.\\n\\n## 3.2 Asymptotic notation: formal definitions\\nFunctions are typically defined on natural numbers $\\\\mathbb{N}$.\\n\\n### 3.2.1 $O$-notation (Big-O notation)\\n$O(g(n)) = \\\\{f(n) : \\\\text{there exist positive constants } c \\\\text{ and } n_0 \\\\text{ such that } 0 \\\\le f(n) \\\\le cg(n) \\\\text{ for all } n \\\\ge n_0\\\\}$.\\n$f(n)$ must be asymptotically nonnegative. $g(n)$ must also be asymptotically nonnegative.\\nExample: $4n^2+100n+500 = O(n^2)$ because for $c=5.05$ and $n_0=100$, $4n^2+100n+500 \\\\le 5.05n^2$.\\n\\n### 3.2.2 $\\\\Omega$-notation (Big-Omega notation)\\n$\\\\Omega(g(n)) = \\\\{f(n) : \\\\text{there exist positive constants } c \\\\text{ and } n_0 \\\\text{ such that } 0 \\\\le cg(n) \\\\le f(n) \\\\text{ for all } n \\\\ge n_0\\\\}$.\\nExample: $4n^2+100n+500 = \\\\Omega(n^2)$ because for $c=4$ and $n_0=1$, $4n^2 \\\\le 4n^2+100n+500$.\\n\\n### 3.2.3 $\\\\Theta$-notation (Theta-notation)\\n$\\\\Theta(g(n)) = \\\\{f(n) : \\\\text{there exist positive constants } c_1, c_2, \\\\text{ and } n_0 \\\\text{ such that } 0 \\\\le c_1 g(n) \\\\le f(n) \\\\le c_2 g(n) \\\\text{ for all } n \\\\ge n_0\\\\}$.\\n*Theorem 3.1*: For any two functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$, $f(n) = \\\\Theta(g(n))$ if and only if $f(n) = O(g(n))$ and $f(n) = \\\\Omega(g(n))$.\\nWhen characterizing running times, use the most precise bound possible (often $\\\\Theta$) and specify if it's worst-case, best-case, or applies to all cases (e.g., merge sort's running time is $\\\\Theta(n \\\\lg n)$ for all cases).\\n\\n### 3.2.4 Asymptotic notation in equations and inequalities\\n$f(n) = O(g(n))$ means $f(n) \\\\in O(g(n))$.\\nIn a formula like $2n^2 + 3n + 1 = 2n^2 + \\\\Theta(n)$, $\\\\Theta(n)$ stands for an anonymous function $h(n) \\\\in \\\\Theta(n)$ (here, $h(n)=3n+1$).\\nAn equation like $2n^2 + \\\\Theta(n) = \\\\Theta(n^2)$ means that for any function $f(n) \\\\in \\\\Theta(n)$ on the left, there exists a function $g(n) \\\\in \\\\Theta(n^2)$ on the right that makes the equation true.\\n\\n### 3.2.5 Proper abuses of asymptotic notation\\n- The variable tending to $\\\\infty$ is inferred from context (e.g., $f(n)=O(1)$ means $f(n)$ is bounded by a constant as $n \\\\to \\\\infty$).\\n- $T(n) = O(1)$ for $n < k$ means $\\\\exists c > 0$ s.t. $T(n) \\\\le c$ for $n < k$.\\n\\n### 3.2.6 $o$-notation (Little-o notation)\\nAn upper bound that is not asymptotically tight.\\n$o(g(n)) = \\\\{f(n) : \\\\text{for any positive constant } c > 0, \\\\text{ there exists a constant } n_0 > 0 \\\\text{ such that } 0 \\\\le f(n) < cg(n) \\\\text{ for all } n \\\\ge n_0\\\\}$.\\nIntuitively, $f(n)$ becomes insignificant relative to $g(n)$ as $n$ gets large. $\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 0$.\\nExample: $2n = o(n^2)$, but $2n^2 \\\\neq o(n^2)$.\\n\\n### 3.2.7 $\\\\omega$-notation (Little-omega notation)\\nA lower bound that is not asymptotically tight.\\n$\\\\omega(g(n)) = \\\\{f(n) : \\\\text{for any positive constant } c > 0, \\\\text{ there exists a constant } n_0 > 0 \\\\text{ such that } 0 \\\\le cg(n) < f(n) \\\\text{ for all } n \\\\ge n_0\\\\}$.\\nIntuitively, $f(n)$ becomes arbitrarily large relative to $g(n)$ as $n$ gets large. $\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = \\\\infty$.\\nAlso, $f(n) \\\\in \\\\omega(g(n)) \\\\iff g(n) \\\\in o(f(n))$.\\nExample: $n^2/2 = \\\\omega(n)$, but $n^2/2 \\\\neq \\\\omega(n^2)$.\\n\\n### 3.2.8 Comparing functions (Properties for asymptotically positive $f, g$)\\n- *Transitivity*: Holds for $\\\\Theta, O, \\\\Omega, o, \\\\omega$.\\n- *Reflexivity*: $f(n) = \\\\Theta(f(n))$, $f(n) = O(f(n))$, $f(n) = \\\\Omega(f(n))$.\\n- *Symmetry*: $f(n) = \\\\Theta(g(n)) \\\\iff g(n) = \\\\Theta(f(n))$.\\n- *Transpose symmetry*: $f(n) = O(g(n)) \\\\iff g(n) = \\\\Omega(f(n))$; $f(n) = o(g(n)) \\\\iff g(n) = \\\\omega(f(n))$.\\n*Trichotomy* ($a<b, a=b, \\text{or } a>b$) does not hold for functions; e.g., $n$ and $n^{1+\\\\sin n}$ are not asymptotically comparable.\\n\\n## 3.3 Standard notations and common functions\\n\\n### 3.3.1 Monotonicity\\n- *Monotonically increasing*: $m \\\\le n \\\\implies f(m) \\\\le f(n)$.\\n- *Monotonically decreasing*: $m \\\\le n \\\\implies f(m) \\\\ge f(n)$.\\n- *Strictly increasing*: $m < n \\\\implies f(m) < f(n)$.\\n- *Strictly decreasing*: $m < n \\\\implies f(m) > f(n)$.\\n\\n### 3.3.2 Floors and ceilings\\n- $\\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor$: greatest integer $\\\\le x$.\\n- $\\\\lceil x \\\\rceil$: least integer $\\\\ge x$.\\nProperties: $x-1 < \\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor \\\\le x \\\\le \\\\lceil x \\\\rceil < x+1$.

Mathematical sets are unchanging, but algorithms manipulate **dynamic sets** that can grow, shrink, or change over time. This part presents basic techniques for representing finite dynamic sets and manipulating them on a computer.\\n\\nOperations on sets can include inserting elements, deleting elements, and testing membership. A dynamic set supporting these is a **dictionary**. More complicated operations might be needed, like in min-priority queues (Chapter 6) which support inserting an element and extracting the smallest element. The best way to implement a dynamic set depends on the required operations.\\n\\n## Elements of a dynamic set\\nEach element is typically an object with attributes. Some dynamic sets assume one attribute is an identifying **key**. If keys are unique, the set can be viewed as a set of key values. Objects may contain **satellite data**, carried with the object but unused by set implementation, and other attributes manipulated by set operations (data or pointers to other objects in the set).\\nSome dynamic sets assume keys are from a totally ordered set (e.g., real numbers, words under alphabetic order), allowing definition of minimum/maximum elements or next/previous element.\\n\\n## Operations on dynamic sets\\nOperations are grouped into **queries** (return information) and **modifying operations** (change the set).\\nTypical operations:\\n- `SEARCH(S, k)`: Query, returns a pointer to an element x in S with x.key = k, or NIL.\\n- `INSERT(S, x)`: Modifying, adds element x to S. Assumes attributes needed by implementation are initialized.\\n- `DELETE(S, x)`: Modifying, removes element x from S (takes pointer, not key value).\\n- `MINIMUM(S)` and `MAXIMUM(S)`: Queries on totally ordered set S, return pointer to element with smallest/largest key.\\n- `SUCCESSOR(S, x)`: Query on totally ordered set S, returns pointer to next larger element than x, or NIL if x is maximum.\\n- `PREDECESSOR(S, x)`: Query on totally ordered set S, returns pointer to next smaller element than x, or NIL if x is minimum.\\n`SUCCESSOR` and `PREDECESSOR` can be extended to sets with nondistinct keys. `MINIMUM` followed by $n-1$ calls to `SUCCESSOR` enumerates elements in sorted order.\\nTime complexity is usually measured in terms of set size $n$.\\n\\n## Overview of Part III Chapters\\n- **Chapter 10 (Elementary Data Structures)**: Essentials of arrays, matrices, stacks, queues, linked lists, and rooted trees. Much may be familiar from introductory programming.\\n- **Chapter 11 (Hash Tables)**: Widely used for dictionary operations. Worst-case search $\\\\Theta(n)$, but expected time is $O(1)$ under reasonable assumptions.\\n- **Chapter 12 (Binary Search Trees)**: Support all dynamic-set operations. Worst-case $\\\\Theta(n)$ time per operation. Basis for many other data structures.\\n- **Chapter 13 (Red-Black Trees)**: Variant of binary search trees. Guaranteed $O(\\\\lg n)$ worst-case time for operations. A balanced search tree.\\n\\nImplementing a dynamic set with an array:\\n- Advantage: Simple algorithms.\\n- Downside: Many operations $\\\\Theta(n)$ worst-case time.\\n  - Unsorted array: `INSERT` and `DELETE` (if deleting last element or order doesn't matter for deletion position) can be $\\\\Theta(1)$, others $\\\\Theta(n)$.\\n  - Sorted array: `MINIMUM`, `MAXIMUM`, `SUCCESSOR`, `PREDECESSOR` take $\\\\Theta(1)$; `SEARCH` takes $O(\\\\lg n)$ (binary search); `INSERT` and `DELETE` take $\\\\Theta(n)$.\\nData structures in this part improve upon array implementations for many dynamic-set operations.\\n\\n# 10 Elementary Data Structures\\nThis chapter examines representation of dynamic sets by simple data structures using pointers: arrays, matrices, stacks, queues, linked lists, and rooted trees.\\n\\n## 10.1 Simple array-based data structures: arrays, matrices, stacks, queues\\n\\n### 10.1.1 Arrays\\nAn array is stored as a contiguous sequence of bytes in memory. If the first element has index $s$, starts at memory address $a$, and each element occupies $b$ bytes, the $i$-th element occupies bytes $a+b(i-s)$ through $a+b(i-s+1)-1$. Accessing any array element takes constant time (RAM model assumption).\\nMost languages require elements of an array to be the same size. If elements vary in size, array elements are usually pointers to objects, and pointer sizes are constant.\\n\\n### 10.1.2 Matrices\\nA matrix (2D array) is typically represented by one or more 1D arrays. For an $m \\\\times n$ matrix:\\n- **Row-major order**: Matrix stored row by row.\\n- **Column-major order**: Matrix stored column by column.\\nFor an $m \\\\times n$ matrix $M$ with 0-origin indexing, $M[i, j]$ is at index $ni+j$ (row-major) or $i+mj$ (column-major) in a single 1D array.\\nMultiple-array strategies: An array of pointers, where each pointer points to an array representing a row (for row-major) or a column (for column-major). These can be more flexible (e.g., ragged arrays) but single-array representations are often more efficient.\\n**Block representation**: Matrix divided into blocks, each block stored contiguously.\\n\\n### 10.1.3 Stacks and queues\\nDynamic sets where the element removed by `DELETE` is prespecified.\\n- **Stack**: Implements a last-in, first-out (LIFO) policy. `INSERT` is `PUSH`, `DELETE` (no argument) is `POP`.\\n- **Queue**: Implements a first-in, first-out (FIFO) policy. `INSERT` is `ENQUEUE`, `DELETE` (no argument) is `DEQUEUE`.\\n\\n**Stacks**\\nImplemented with an array $S[1..n]$. Attributes: $S.top$ (index of most recently inserted element) and $S.size$ (size $n$ of array). Elements $S[1..S.top]$.\\n- $S.top = 0$: stack is empty.\\n- Test for empty: [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#10.1.3 STACK-EMPTY]].\\n- Pop from empty stack: **underflow**.\\n- Push to full stack ($S.top = S.size$): **overflow**.\\nOperations [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#10.1.3 PUSH (S, x)]] and [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#10.1.3 POP (S)]] take $O(1)$ time.\\n\\n**Queues**\\nImplemented with an array $Q[1..n]$. Attributes: $Q.size$ (size $n$ of array), $Q.head$ (indexes head), $Q.tail$ (indexes next location for new element).\\nElements are in $Q.head, Q.head+1, \\\\dots, Q.tail-1$, with wrap-around (location 1 follows $n$).\\n- $Q.head = Q.tail$: queue is empty. Initially $Q.head = Q.tail = 1$.\\n- Dequeue from empty queue: **underflow**.\\n- Enqueue to full queue ($Q.head = Q.tail+1$ or ($Q.head=1$ and $Q.tail=Q.size$)): **overflow**. A queue can hold at most $n-1$ elements with this setup.\\nOperations [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#10.1.3 ENQUEUE (Q, x)]] and [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#10.1.3 DEQUEUE (Q)]] take $O(1)$ time. Error checking for underflow/overflow is omitted in book pseudocode but Exercise 10.1-5 asks to add it.\\n\\n## 10.2 Linked lists\\nA data structure where objects are in linear order determined by a pointer in each object.\\nEach element of a **doubly linked list** $L$ is an object with `key`, `next` pointer, and `prev` pointer. May also contain satellite data.\\n- `x.prev = NIL`: $x$ is the **head** (first element).\\n- `x.next = NIL`: $x$ is the **tail** (last element).\\n- `L.head`: points to the first element. If `L.head = NIL`, list is empty.\\nForms of lists:\\n- **Singly linked**: elements have `next` pointer but not `prev`.\\n- **Sorted**: linear order of list corresponds to linear order of keys.\\n- **Unsorted**: elements can appear in any order.\\n- **Circular**: `prev` pointer of head points to tail, `next` pointer of tail points to head.\\nThis section assumes unsorted, doubly linked lists.\\n\\n**Searching a linked list**\\nProcedure [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#10.2 LIST-SEARCH (L, k)]] finds first element with key $k$ by linear search. Takes $\\\\Theta(n)$ time in worst case for an $n$-object list.\\n\\n**Inserting into a linked list**\\nProcedure [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#10.2 LIST-PREPEND (L, x)]] adds $x$ to front of list in $O(1)$ time.\\nProcedure [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#10.2 LIST-INSERT (x, y)]] inserts element $x$ immediately following element $y$ in $O(1)$ time. (Assumes pointer $y$ is given).\\n\\n**Deleting from a linked list**\\nProcedure [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#10.2 LIST-DELETE (L, x)]] removes element $x$ (given by pointer) in $O(1)$ time. To delete an element with a given key, first call `LIST-SEARCH`, making worst-case $\\\\Theta(n)$.\\nInsertion/deletion are faster on doubly linked lists ($O(1)$ if pointer given) than arrays ($\\\\Theta(n)$ for first element if order maintained). Finding $k$-th element is $O(1)$ in array, $\\\\Theta(k)$ in list.\\n\\n**Sentinels**\\nA **sentinel** is a dummy object to simplify boundary conditions. For list $L$, $L.nil$ represents NIL but has all attributes of other objects. Turns a doubly linked list into a **circular, doubly linked list with a sentinel**.\\n- $L.nil$ lies between head and tail.\\n- $L.nil.next$ points to head. $L.nil.prev$ points to tail.\\n- `next` of tail and `prev` of head point to $L.nil$.\\n- $L.head$ attribute can be eliminated, use $L.nil.next$.\\n- Empty list: $L.nil.next$ and $L.nil.prev$ point to $L.nil$.\\nSimplified procedures (denoted with prime):\\n- [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#10.2 LIST-DELETE' (x) (with sentinel)]]: $O(1)$.\\n- [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#10.2 LIST-INSERT' (x, y) (with sentinel)]]: $O(1)$. To insert at head, let $y = L.nil$. To insert at tail, let $y = L.nil.prev$.\\n- [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#10.2 LIST-SEARCH' (L, k) (with sentinel)]]: Stores key $k$ in sentinel before search. Loop compares only $x.key \\ne k$. If $x$ becomes $L.nil$, key wasn't in original list. Can decrease constant factor in search time. Sentinels use extra storage, use judiciously.\\n\\n## 10.3 Representing rooted trees\\nLinked data structures for rooted trees. Each node is an object with `key` and pointers.\\n\\n**Binary trees**\\nAttributes $p, left, right$ for parent, left child, right child. If $x.p = NIL$, $x$ is root. If no left/right child, corresponding attribute is NIL. Tree attribute $T.root$ points to root. If $T.root = NIL$, tree is empty.\\n\\n**Rooted trees with unbounded branching**\\nIf max children $k$ is small constant, can use $child_1, \\text{child}_2, \\text{...}, child_k$. Not suitable for unbounded or large $k$.\\n**Left-child, right-sibling representation**: Uses $O(n)$ space for $n$-node tree.\\nEach node $x$ has parent pointer $p$, and T.root points to root. Node $x$ has two pointers:\\n1. $x.left\\text{-}child$: points to leftmost child of $x$.\\n2. $x.right\\text{-}sibling$: points to sibling of $x$ immediately to its right.\\nIf $x$ has no children, $x.left\\text{-}child = NIL$. If $x$ is rightmost child, $x.right\\text{-}sibling = NIL$.\\n\\n**Other tree representations**\\nExample: Heap (Chapter 6) represented by single array. Trees in Chapter 19 (for disjoint sets) traversed only toward root, so only parent pointers. Choice depends on application.\\n\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"file\": \"PartIII Data Structures/C11 Hash Tables.md\",\n                \"contents\": \"# 11 Hash Tables\\nMany applications require a dynamic set supporting only dictionary operations: `INSERT`, `SEARCH`, `DELETE`. A **hash table** is an effective data structure for dictionaries. Average time for search is $O(1)$ under reasonable assumptions, though worst-case can be $\\\\Theta(n)$.\\nA hash table generalizes an array. Direct addressing (Section 11.1) uses a key as a direct index into an array. Hash tables compute an array index from the key using a **hash function**, typically using an array size proportional to number of keys stored, not total possible keys.\\n\\n## 11.1 Direct-address tables\\nWorks well when universe $U$ of keys is small. Dynamic set elements have distinct keys from $U = \\\\{0, 1, \\\\dots, m-1\\\\}$.\\nUse a **direct-address table** (array) $T[0..m-1]$. Each position (slot) corresponds to a key in $U$.\\n- Slot $k$ points to element with key $k$. If no such element, $T[k] = NIL$.\\nDictionary operations:\\n- [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#11.1 DIRECT-ADDRESS-SEARCH (T, k)]]\\n- [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#11.1 DIRECT-ADDRESS-INSERT (T, x)]]\\n- [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#11.1 DIRECT-ADDRESS-DELETE (T, x)]]\\nEach takes $O(1)$ time. Direct-address table can store elements themselves or pointers. Special key can indicate empty slot, or index implies key. A bit vector can represent set of distinct elements with no satellite data.\\n\\n## 11.2 Hash tables\\nWhen universe $U$ is large, direct addressing is impractical. If set $K$ of stored keys is much smaller than $U$, hash table storage is $\\\\Theta(|K|)$. Search is $O(1)$ on average.\\nA **hash function** $h$ maps keys from $U$ to slots in hash table $T[0..m-1]$: $h: U \\\\rightarrow \\\\{0, 1, \\\\dots, m-1\\\\}$.\\nElement with key $k$ hashes to slot $h(k)$. $h(k)$ is the **hash value** of $k$.\\n**Collision**: Two keys hash to the same slot. Resolved using techniques like chaining or open addressing.\\nIdeally, hash function distributes keys randomly. However, if $|U| > m$, collisions are unavoidable (pigeonhole principle).\\n\\n**Independent uniform hashing**\\nAn ideal hash function $h$ would have $h(k)$ be a randomly and independently chosen value from $\\\\{0, 1, \\\\dots, m-1\\\\}$ for each $k \\n\\n## 13.2 Rotations\\nSearch-tree operations like `TREE-INSERT` and `TREE-DELETE` take $O(\\\\lg n)$ time on a red-black tree but may violate red-black properties. **Rotation** is a local operation that changes pointer structure while preserving the binary-search-tree property. It's used to restore red-black properties.\\nThere are two kinds of rotations: left and right, as shown in Figure 13.2 of the book.\\n\\n**Left Rotation**\\n`LEFT-ROTATE(T, x)` transforms the structure assuming $x.right \\\\neq T.nil$ and root's parent is $T.nil$. If $y = x.right$, $y$ becomes the new root of the subtree. $x$ becomes $y$'s left child. $y$'s original left child $\\\\beta$ becomes $x$'s right child.\\nPseudocode: [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#13.2 LEFT-ROTATE (T, x)]]\\n\\n**Right Rotation**\\n`RIGHT-ROTATE(T, y)` is symmetric to `LEFT-ROTATE(T, x)`. If $x = y.left$, $x$ becomes the new root. $y$ becomes $x$'s right child. $x$'s original right child $\\\\beta$ becomes $y$'s left child.\\nPseudocode: [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#13.2 RIGHT-ROTATE (T, y)]]\\nBoth `LEFT-ROTATE` and `RIGHT-ROTATE` run in $O(1)$ time. Only pointers are changed.\\n\\n## 13.3 Insertion\\nTo insert a node $z$ into an $n$-node red-black tree $T$ in $O(\\\\lg n)$ time while maintaining red-black properties:\\n1. Use a modified `TREE-INSERT` to insert $z$ into $T$ as if it were an ordinary binary search tree.\\n2. Color $z$ red.\\n3. Call an auxiliary procedure `RB-INSERT-FIXUP` to restore red-black properties.\\n\\nThe procedure [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#13.3 RB-INSERT (T, z)]] handles this. Differences from `TREE-INSERT`:\\n- All `NIL` instances replaced by `T.nil`.\\n- $z.left$ and $z.right$ are set to `T.nil` (lines 14-15).\\n- $z$ is colored red (line 16).\\n- `RB-INSERT-FIXUP(T, z)` is called (line 17).\\n\\n**RB-INSERT-FIXUP**\\nPseudocode: [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#13.3 RB-INSERT-FIXUP (T, z)]]\\nViolations that can occur when a red node $z$ is inserted:\\n- Property 2 (root is black): If $z$ is the root.\\n- Property 4 (red node has black children): If $z.p$ is red.\\n(Properties 1, 3, 5 remain satisfied initially.)\\n\\nThe `while` loop (lines 1-29) aims to fix violations. Loop invariant at the start of each iteration:\\na. Node $z$ is red.\\nb. If $z.p$ is the root, then $z.p$ is black.\\nc. If the tree violates any red-black properties, it's at most one: either property 2 ( $z$ is root and red) or property 4 ($z$ and $z.p$ are red).\\n\\n**Initialization**: The invariant holds before the first iteration.\\n- (a) $z$ is the newly added red node.\\n- (b) If $z.p$ is root, it was black (original root or $T.nil$).\\n- (c) As discussed above, only property 2 or 4 can be violated.\\n\\n**Maintenance**: The loop considers three cases (and their symmetric counterparts). We focus on when $z.p$ is a left child ($z.p = z.p.p.left$). $y$ is $z$'s uncle ($z.p.p.right$). $z.p.p$ exists and is black (since $z.p$ is red, violating property 4 with $z$, so $z.p$ cannot be root; if $z.p$ is red, its parent $z.p.p$ must be black).\\n\\n- **Case 1: $z$'s uncle $y$ is red** (lines 4-8)\\n  - $z.p$ and $y$ are colored black.\\n  - $z.p.p$ is colored red (to maintain black-heights - property 5).\\n  - $z$ moves up to $z.p.p$.\\n  - The invariant is maintained for the new $z$. Pointer $z$ moves two levels up. The only possible violation of property 4 is now between new $z$ (which is red) and its parent, if its parent is also red.\\n\\n- **Case 2: $z$'s uncle $y$ is black, and $z$ is a right child** (lines 10-12)\\n  - $z$ is updated to $z.p$.\\n  - A `LEFT-ROTATE` on the new $z$ transforms this into Case 3.\\n  - Both $z$ and new $z.p$ (original $z$) are red, violating property 4. Black-heights and property 5 are preserved.\\n\\n- **Case 3: $z$'s uncle $y$ is black, and $z$ is a left child** (lines 13-15)\\n  - $z.p$ is colored black.\\n  - $z.p.p$ is colored red.\\n  - A `RIGHT-ROTATE` on $z.p.p$.\\n  - This resolves the property 4 violation between $z$ and $z.p$. No new violations are introduced. The new $z.p$ is black, so the `while` loop terminates.\\n\\n**Termination**: The loop terminates because either $z.p$ becomes black (Case 3 handles this directly, or Case 2 transforms to Case 3) or $z$ moves up the tree (Case 1). If $z$ reaches the root, $z.p$ is $T.nil$, which is black, so loop terminates. Line 30 ensures property 2 (root is black) holds.\\n\\n**Analysis**: `RB-INSERT` takes $O(\\\\lg n)$ time. `RB-INSERT-FIXUP` loop runs $O(\\\\lg n)$ times (Case 1 moves $z$ up). Rotations are $O(1)$, at most 2 rotations occur. Total time $O(\\\\lg n)$.\\n\\n## 13.4 Deletion\\nDeletion also takes $O(\\\\lg n)$ time. It's based on `TREE-DELETE`.\\nCustomized [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#13.4 RB-TRANSPLANT (T, u, v)]] is used, similar to `TRANSPLANT` but references `T.nil` and $v.p$ is always set.\\n\\nThe procedure [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#13.4 RB-DELETE (T, z)]] is structured like `TREE-DELETE`.\\n- $y$ is the node either removed from the tree or moved within the tree. If $z$ has $\\\\le 1$ child, $y=z$. If $z$ has 2 children, $y=TREE-MINIMUM(z.right)$ (z's successor).\\n- $x$ is the node that moves into $y$'s original position.\\n- `y-original-color` stores $y$'s color before it's changed or $y$ is moved.\\n- If $y$ was black, its removal/movement could violate red-black properties. `RB-DELETE-FIXUP(T, x)` is called to restore them.\\n  - If $y$ was red, properties still hold: no black-heights change, no red nodes made adjacent, root remains black (if $y$ was red, it wasn't root).\\n\\n**RB-DELETE-FIXUP**\\nPseudocode: [[PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md#13.4 RB-DELETE-FIXUP (T, x)]]\\nCalled when $y$, which was black, is removed or moved. Node $x$ now has an \\\"extra black\\\".\\nGoal of `while` loop (lines 1-43): Move the extra black up the tree until:\\n1. $x$ points to a red-and-black node (becomes singly black by coloring $x$ black - line 44).\\n2. $x$ points to the root (extra black can be removed).\\n3.

An *instance of a problem* is any input that satisfies these constraints.\\nAn *algorithm* is a well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as *input* and produces some value, or set of values, as *output*. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output. An algorithm is a tool for solving a well-specified *computational problem*.\\nA *data structure* is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.\\n\\n## 2 Getting Started (Summary)\\n\\n### 2.1 Analyzing Algorithms\\nAnalyzing an algorithm means predicting the resources that the algorithm requires. Resources such as memory, communication bandwidth, or computational hardware are of primary concern, but most often it is *computational time* that we want to measure.\\n*Input size* depends on the problem being studied. For many problems, such as sorting or Fourier transforms, the most natural measure is the number of items in the input\\u2014for example, the number $n$ of items being sorted.\\n*Running time* of an algorithm on a particular input is the number of primitive operations or \\u201csteps\\u201d executed. It is convenient to define the notion of step so that it is as machine-independent as possible.\\n\\n### 2.2 Designing Algorithms\\nOne common algorithmic technique is *incremental approach*: having sorted the subarray $A[1 .. j-1]$, we insert the single element $A[j]$ into its proper place, yielding the sorted subarray $A[1 .. j]$.\\n\\n### 2.3 Loop Invariants and Correctness\\nA *loop invariant* is a property used to help show that an algorithm is correct. For a loop invariant, we must show three things:\\n- **Initialization**: It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop.\\n- **Maintenance**: If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration.\\n- **Termination**: When the loop terminates, the invariant\\u2014usually along with the reason that the loop terminated\\u2014gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct.\\n\\n## 3 Characterizing Running Times (Summary)\\n\\nWe usually focus on the *worst-case running time*: the longest running time for any input of size $n$. Reasons include: it's an upper bound, the worst case occurs fairly often for some algorithms, and the average case is often as bad as the worst case.\\nThe *order of growth* or *rate of growth* of the running time is an abstraction that considers only the leading term of a formula for running time, ignoring lower-order terms and the leading term's constant coefficient. This simplifies comparisons of algorithm efficiency, especially for large inputs.\\n\\n### 3.1 Asymptotic Notation\\nAsymptotic notation provides a way to describe the behavior of functions in the limit, typically used for characterizing algorithm running times.\\n- **$\\\\\\\\Theta(g(n))$: Asymptotically tight bound**\\n  $\\\\\\\\Theta(g(n)) = \\\\\\\\{f(n) : \\\\\\\\exists c_1 > 0, c_2 > 0, n_0 > 0 \\\\\\\\text{ s.t. } 0 \\\\\\\\le c_1 g(n) \\\\\\\\le f(n) \\\\\\\\le c_2 g(n) \\\\\\\\forall n \\\\\\\\ge n_0 \\\\\\\\}$.\\n- **$O(g(n))$: Asymptotic upper bound**\\n  $O(g(n)) = \\\\\\\\{f(n) : \\\\\\\\exists c > 0, n_0 > 0 \\\\\\\\text{ s.t. } 0 \\\\\\\\le f(n) \\\\\\\\le c g(n) \\\\\\\\forall n \\\\\\\\ge n_0 \\\\\\\\}$.\\n- **$\\\\\\\\Omega(g(n))$: Asymptotic lower bound**\\n  $\\\\\\\\Omega(g(n)) = \\\\\\\\{f(n) : \\\\\\\\exists c > 0, n_0 > 0 \\\\\\\\text{ s.t. } 0 \\\\\\\\le c g(n) \\\\\\\\le f(n) \\\\\\\\forall n \\\\\\\\ge n_0 \\\\\\\\}$.\\n- **$o(g(n))$: Asymptotic upper bound, not tight**\\n  $o(g(n)) = \\\\\\\\{f(n) : \\\\\\\\forall c > 0, \\\\\\\\exists n_0 > 0 \\\\\\\\text{ s.t. } 0 \\\\\\\\le f(n) < c g(n) \\\\\\\\forall n \\\\\\\\ge n_0 \\\\\\\\}$. This implies $\\\\\\\\lim_{n\\\\\\\\to\\\\\\\\infty} f(n)/g(n) = 0$.\\n- **$\\\\\\\\omega(g(n))$: Asymptotic lower bound, not tight**\\n  $\\\\\\\\omega(g(n)) = \\\\\\\\{f(n) : \\\\\\\\forall c > 0, \\\\\\\\exists n_0 > 0 \\\\\\\\text{ s.t. } 0 \\\\\\\\le c g(n) < f(n) \\\\\\\\forall n \\\\\\\\ge n_0 \\\\\\\\}$. This implies $\\\\\\\\lim_{n\\\\\\\\to\\\\\\\\infty} f(n)/g(n) = \\\\\\\\infty$.\\n\\n## 4 Divide-and-Conquer Overview\\nThe divide-and-conquer method is a powerful strategy for designing asymptotically efficient algorithms. It involves three characteristic steps:\\n1.  **Divide** the problem into one or more subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.\\n2.  **Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively. If a subproblem size is small enough (base case), solve it directly.\\n3.  **Combine** the subproblem solutions to form a solution to the original problem.\\n\\nRunning times of divide-and-conquer algorithms are often described by *recurrence relations* (or recurrences), which are equations or inequalities that describe a function in terms of its value on smaller inputs. For example, the recurrence for merge sort is $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \\\\\\\\Theta(n)$, with solution $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n \\\\\\\\lg n)$.\\n\\nSeveral methods are used to solve recurrences:\\n- **Substitution method**: Guess the form of the solution and use mathematical induction to find constants and show that the solution works.\\n- **Recursion-tree method**: Convert the recurrence into a tree whose nodes represent costs at various levels of recursion. Sum costs to obtain a guess for the solution, then verify with substitution.\\n- **Master method**: Provides a 'cookbook' for solving recurrences of the form $T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)$, where $a \\\\\\\\ge 1, b > 1$. It compares $f(n)$ with $n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a}$ and has three cases.\\n- **Akra-Bazzi method**: Generalizes the master method for recurrences of the form $T(n) = f(n) + \\\\\\\\sum_{i=1}^k a_i T(n/b_i)$. It requires $f(n)$ to satisfy a polynomial-growth condition and involves solving for a unique $p$ such that $\\\\\\\\sum a_i / b_i^p = 1$.\\n\\nExamples of divide-and-conquer include matrix multiplication. A simple recursive approach leads to $T(n) = 8T(n/2) + \\\\\\\\Theta(1)$, yielding $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^3)$. Strassen's algorithm improves this to $T(n) = 7T(n/2) + \\\\\\\\Theta(n^2)$, solving to $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^{\\\\\\\\lg 7}) \\\\\\\\approx \\\\\\\\Theta(n^{2.81})$.\\n\\n## 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms Overview\\n\\n*Probabilistic analysis* is the use of probability in analyzing problems or algorithms. It typically involves computing an average-case running time by taking the expectation over a distribution of possible inputs. This requires knowledge or assumptions about the input distribution.\\n\\n*Randomized algorithms* make random choices during their execution. Their behavior is determined not only by input but also by values from a random-number generator. The running time of a randomized algorithm is an *expected running time*, where the expectation is over the random choices made by the algorithm, for any specific input.\\n\\n*Indicator random variables* are a useful tool. For an event $A$, the indicator random variable $I\\\\\\\\{A\\\\\\\\}$ is 1 if $A$ occurs and 0 otherwise. A key property is $E[I\\\\\\\\{A\\\\\\\\}] = Pr\\\\\\\\{A\\\\\\\\}$. Linearity of expectation states that the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their expectations, even if they are dependent. This simplifies many analyses.\\n\\n**The Hiring Problem**: An example where a candidate is hired if better than all previous ones. If candidates arrive in random order (probabilistic analysis), the expected number of hires is $H_n = \\\\\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (1/i) = \\\\\\\\ln n + O(1)$. A randomized version permutes candidates first, achieving the same expected number of hires for any input.\\n\\n**Randomly Permuting Arrays**: Generating a uniform random permutation (each of $n!$ permutations equally likely) is crucial for many randomized algorithms. The `RANDOMLY-PERMUTE` algorithm achieves this in $O(n)$ time by iteratively swapping $A[i]$ with a random element from $A[i..n]$.\\n\\nFurther examples illustrating these concepts include:\\n- **Birthday Paradox**: With 23 people, probability of a shared birthday is >0.5. Expected number of shared-birthday pairs is 1 with about $\\\\\\\\sqrt{2n}$ people (for $n$ days in year).\\n- **Balls and Bins**: Tossing $n$ balls into $b$ bins. The coupon collector's problem (expected tosses to hit all $b$ bins) is $bH_b \\\\\\\\approx b \\\\\\\\ln b$.\\n- **Streaks**: Longest expected streak of heads in $n$ coin flips is $\\\\\\\\Theta(\\\\\\\\lg n)$.\\n- **Online Hiring Problem**: Hire exactly once by interviewing/rejecting first $k$ candidates, then hiring next best. Optimal $k \\\\\\\\approx n/e$ yields success probability $\\\\\\\\approx 1/e$.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"file\": \"PartI Foundations Algorithms.md\",\n                \"contents\": \"# Part I Foundations Algorithms\\n\\n## C4 Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms\\n\\n### 4.1 MATRIX-MULTIPLY\\n```\\nMATRIX-MULTIPLY(A, B, C, n)\\n  // Assumes A, B, C are n x n matrices.

It involves breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving these recursively, and then combining their solutions. We explore applications of this method and acquire mathematical tools for analyzing the recurrences that arise.\\n\\nRecall that for divide-and-conquer, you solve a given problem (instance) recursively. If the problem is small enough\\u2014the *base case*\\u2014you just solve it directly without recursing. Otherwise\\u2014the *recursive case*\\u2014you perform three characteristic steps:\\n- **Divide** the problem into one or more subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.\\n- **Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively.\\n- **Combine** the subproblem solutions to form a solution to the original problem.\\nA divide-and-conquer algorithm breaks down a large problem into smaller subproblems, which themselves may be broken down. The recursion bottoms out when it reaches a base case.\\n\\n## 4.1 Recurrences\\nTo analyze recursive divide-and-conquer algorithms, we use recurrences.\\nA *recurrence* is an equation or inequality that describes a function in terms of its value on other, typically smaller, arguments. Recurrences characterize the running times of recursive algorithms mathematically.\\n\\nAn *algorithmic recurrence* $T(n)$ describes the running time of a divide-and-conquer algorithm. For every sufficiently large threshold constant $n_0 > 0$, it typically satisfies two properties:\\n1.  For all $n < n_0$, $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(1)$.\\n2.  For all $n \\\\\\\\ge n_0$, every path of recursion terminates in a defined base case within a finite number of recursive invocations.\\n\\n**Conventions for recurrences**: Whenever a recurrence is stated without an explicit base case, we assume that the recurrence is algorithmic, meaning $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(1)$ for sufficiently small $n$. Asymptotic solutions often do not change when floors or ceilings are dropped, simplifying analysis.\\n\\nIf a recurrence is an inequality, such as $T(n) \\\\\\\\le 2T(n/2) + \\\\\\\\Theta(n)$, its solution is expressed using $O$-notation. If $T(n) \\\\\\\\ge 2T(n/2) + \\\\\\\\Theta(n)$, its solution uses $\\\\\\\\Omega$-notation.\\n\\n**Examples of recurrences**: \\n- A simple matrix multiplication algorithm breaking an $n \\\\times n$ problem into four $n/2 \\\\times n/2$ subproblems might have a recurrence $T(n) = 4T(n/2) + \\\\\\\\Theta(n^2)$ if combining costs $\\\\\\\\Theta(n^2)$, but the text uses $T(n) = 8T(n/2) + \\\\\\\\Theta(1)$ for the basic recursive version if partitioning and combining basic scalar operations are $\\\\\\\\Theta(1)$ relative to subproblem calls.

Their product $C = A \\ncdot B$ is also $n \\\\times n$, where $c_{ij} = \\\\\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{ik} \\ncdot b_{kj}$.\\n\\n**Straightforward algorithm**: [[PartI Foundations Algorithms.md#4.1 MATRIX-MULTIPLY]] uses three nested loops and runs in $\\\\\\\\Theta(n^3)$ time. It computes $C = C + A \\ncdot B$. To compute $C = A \\ncdot B$, $C$ must first be initialized to all zeros, taking $\\\\\\\\Theta(n^2)$ time, which is dominated by the $\\\\\\\\Theta(n^3)$ multiplication.\\n\\n**A simple divide-and-conquer algorithm**:\\nPartition $A, B, C$ into four $n/2 \\ntimes n/2$ submatrices each (assuming $n$ is a power of 2):\\n$A = \\\\\\\\begin{pmatrix} A_{11} & A_{12} \\\\\\\\ A_{21} & A_{22} \\\\\\\\end{pmatrix}$, $B = \\\\\\\\begin{pmatrix} B_{11} & B_{12} \\\\\\\\ B_{21} & B_{22} \\\\\\\\end{pmatrix}$, $C = \\\\\\\\begin{pmatrix} C_{11} & C_{12} \\\\\\\\ C_{21} & C_{22} \\\\\\\\end{pmatrix}$.\\nThen compute:\\n$C_{11} = A_{11}B_{11} + A_{12}B_{21}$\\n$C_{12} = A_{11}B_{12} + A_{12}B_{22}$\\n$C_{21} = A_{21}B_{11} + A_{22}B_{21}$\\n$C_{22} = A_{21}B_{12} + A_{22}B_{22}$\\nThis involves 8 recursive multiplications of $n/2 \\ntimes n/2$ matrices and 4 matrix additions (which take $\\\\\\\\Theta(n^2)$ time). If partitioning is done by copying, it takes $\\\\\\\\Theta(n^2)$ time. If done by index calculation, it takes $\\\\\\\\Theta(1)$ time per subproblem creation.\\nThe procedure [[PartI Foundations Algorithms.md#4.1 MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE]] implements this strategy computing $C = C+A \\ncdot B$. It makes 8 recursive calls. If partitioning (line 6) takes $\\\\\\\\Theta(1)$ time (using index calculation), the recurrence for its running time is $T(n) = 8T(n/2) + \\\\\\\\Theta(1)$. This recurrence has the solution $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^3)$, same as the straightforward method. If partitioning involves copying elements taking $\\\\\\\\Theta(n^2)$ time, the recurrence would be $T(n) = 8T(n/2) + \\\\\\\\Theta(n^2)$, which also solves to $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^3)$.\\nThe recursion tree for $T(n) = 8T(n/2) + \\\\\\\\Theta(1)$ is much bushier than for merge sort's $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \\\\\\\\Theta(n)$, leading to a faster-growing solution.\\n\\n## 4.2 Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication\\nStrassen's algorithm (1969) was the first to beat the $\\\\\\\\Theta(n^3)$ time bound for matrix multiplication.

Base case ($n=1$) or partition input matrices ($A, B$) and output matrix ($C$) into $n/2 \\ntimes n/2$ submatrices. This step takes $\\\\\\\\Theta(1)$ time using index calculation.\\n2.  Create 10 matrices $S_1, \\nldots, S_{10}$, each of size $n/2 \\ntimes n/2$. Each $S_i$ is a sum or difference of two submatrices from step 1. This involves 10 matrix additions/subtractions, taking $\\\\\\\\Theta(n^2)$ time.\\n3.  Recursively compute 7 matrix products $P_1, \\nldots, P_7$. Each $P_k$ is a product of an $A$-submatrix (or an $S_i$ derived from $A$-submatrices) and a $B$-submatrix (or an $S_j$ derived from $B$-submatrices). This step makes $7$ recursive calls, taking $7T(n/2)$ time.\\n4.  Compute the desired submatrices $C_{11}, C_{12}, C_{21}, C_{22}$ by adding or subtracting various $P_k$ matrices. This involves 8 matrix additions/subtractions (e.g., $C_{11} = P_5 + P_4 - P_2 + P_6$), taking $\\\\\\\\Theta(n^2)$ time.\\n\\nThe running time is described by the recurrence $T(n) = 7T(n/2) + \\\\\\\\Theta(n^2)$. Using the master method (Case 1, $n^{\\\\\\\\log_2 7}$ vs $n^2$, since $\\\\\\\\lg 7 \\\\\\\\approx 2.807 > 2$), the solution is $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^{\\\\\\\\lg 7})$.\\n\\n## 4.3 The substitution method for solving recurrences\\nThe substitution method for solving recurrences comprises two steps:\\n1.  Guess the form of the solution (e.g., $T(n) = O(g(n))$).\\n2.  Use mathematical induction to find the constants and show that the solution works.\\nThis method is powerful but requires a good guess. It's often used to establish an upper ($O$) or lower ($\\\\\\\\Omega$) bound.\\n\\n**Example**: Solve $T(n) = 2T(\\\\\\\\lfloor n/2 \\\\\\\\rfloor) + \\\\\\\\Theta(n)$. Guess $T(n) = O(n \\\\\\\\lg n)$.\\nInductive hypothesis: Assume $T(k) \\\\\\\\le ck \\\\\\\\lg k$ for $k < n$, specifically for $k = \\\\\\\\lfloor n/2 \\\\\\\\rfloor$. The $\\\\\\\\Theta(n)$ term can be replaced by $dn$ for some constant $d>0$ for an upper bound proof.\\n$T(n) \\\\\\\\le 2(c \\\\\\\\lfloor n/2 \\\\\\\\rfloor \\\\\\\\lg(\\\\\\\\lfloor n/2 \\\\\\\\rfloor)) + dn$\\n$\\\\\\\\le 2(c (n/2) \\\\\\\\lg(n/2)) + dn$\\n$= cn \\\\\\\\lg(n/2) + dn$\\n$= cn (\\\\\\\\lg n - \\\\\\\\lg 2) + dn$\\n$= cn \\\\\\\\lg n - cn + dn$\\nThis is $\\\\\\\\le cn \\\\\\\\lg n$ if $-cn + dn \\\\\\\\le 0$, i.e., $d \\\\\\\\le c$. We can pick $c$ large enough for this to hold.\\nBase cases: We must also show the hypothesis holds for base cases. For $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(1)$ for small $n$, we can choose $c$ large enough such that $cn \\\\\\\\lg n$ is greater than $T(n)$ for these base cases (e.g., for $n=2,3$ if $n_0=2$).\\n\\n**Making a good guess**: Experience, solving similar recurrences, or using recursion trees helps. Loose bounds can be determined and then tightened.\\n\\n**A trick: Subtracting a lower-order term**: If an inductive proof fails because the inductive hypothesis is not strong enough, try subtracting a lower-order term. For $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \\\\\\\\Theta(1)$, guess $T(n) = O(n)$. Assume $T(k) \\\\\\\\le ck$. Then $T(n) \\\\\\\\le 2(c(n/2)) + d_0 = cn + d_0$, which is not $\\\\\\\\le cn$. Instead, guess $T(n) \\\\\\\\le cn - d$ for some $d > 0$.\\n$T(n) \\\\\\\\le 2(c(n/2) - d) + d_0$\\n$= cn - 2d + d_0$\\nThis is $\\\\\\\\le cn - d$ if $-2d + d_0 \\\\\\\\le -d$, which means $d \\\\\\\\ge d_0$. This can be satisfied by choosing $d$ large enough.\\n\\n**Avoiding pitfalls**: Do not use asymptotic notation in the inductive hypothesis (e.g., $T(n) \\\\\\\\le O(n)$). Prove the exact form of the guessed solution (e.g., $T(n) \\\\\\\\le cn$). Constants matter in inductive proofs.\\n\\n## 4.4 The recursion-tree method for solving recurrences\\nThe recursion-tree method converts a recurrence into a tree where each node represents the cost of a single subproblem. Summing costs per level and then across levels gives a guess for the solution. It's good for generating guesses or can be a direct proof if done carefully.\\n\\n**Example**: $T(n) = 3T(n/4) + cn^2$.\\n- Root: cost $cn^2$. Children: 3 nodes, each for $T(n/4)$, cost $c(n/4)^2$.\\n- Level 0: $cn^2$\\n- Level 1: $3 \\ncdot c(n/4)^2 = (3/16)cn^2$\\n- Level 2: $3^2 \\ncdot c((n/4)^2)^2 = (3/16)^2 cn^2$\\n- Level $i$: $3^i \\ncdot c(n/4^i)^2 = (3/16)^i cn^2$\\n- Tree height: Subproblem size $n/4^i = 1 \\\\\\\\implies i = \\\\\\\\log_4 n$. Number of levels is $\\\\\\\\log_4 n + 1$.\\n- Leaves: At depth $\\\\\\\\log_4 n$. Number of leaves $3^{\\\\\\\\log_4 n} = n^{\\\\\\\\log_4 3}$. Each leaf cost is $T(1) = \\\\\\\\Theta(1)$. Total leaf cost $\\\\\\\\Theta(n^{\\\\\\\\log_4 3})$.\\n- Total cost: $T(n) = cn^2 \\\\\\\\sum_{i=0}^{\\\\\\\\log_4 n -1} (3/16)^i + \\\\\\\\Theta(n^{\\\\\\\\log_4 3})$.\\nThe sum is a geometric series $\\\\\\\\sum_{i=0}^{k} x^i \\\\\\\\le 1/(1-x)$ for $x < 1$. Here $x=3/16$.\\n$T(n) \\\\\\\\le cn^2 (1/(1-3/16)) + \\\\\\\\Theta(n^{\\\\\\\\log_4 3}) = cn^2 (16/13) + \\\\\\\\Theta(n^{\\\\\\\\log_4 3})$.\\nSince $\\\\\\\\log_4 3 < 2$, the $cn^2$ term dominates. So $T(n) = O(n^2)$. Since $f(n)=cn^2$ is part of $T(n)$, $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Omega(n^2)$. Thus $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^2)$.\\nThis can be verified by substitution method: $T(n) \\\\\\\\le dn^2$. $3d(n/4)^2 + cn^2 = (3/16)dn^2 + cn^2 \\\\\\\\le dn^2$ if $cn^2 \\\\\\\\le (1 - 3/16)dn^2 = (13/16)dn^2$, so $c \\\\\\\\le (13/16)d$, or $d \\\\\\\\ge (16/13)c$.\\n\\n**Irregular example**: $T(n) = T(n/3) + T(2n/3) + cn$.\\n- Root: $cn$. Children: $T(n/3)$ and $T(2n/3)$ with costs $c(n/3)$ and $c(2n/3)$.\\n- Cost at each level $i$: Sum of costs of nodes is $cn$.\\n- Longest path: $n \\\\\\\\to (2/3)n \\\\\\\\to (2/3)^2 n \\\\\\\\to \\nldots \\\\\\\\to 1$. Height is $\\\\\\\\log_{3/2} n$.\\n- Total cost: $cn \\ncdot (\\\\\\\\log_{3/2} n + 1) = O(n \\\\\\\\lg n)$.\\n- Number of leaves $L(n)$: Recurrence $L(n) = L(n/3) + L(2n/3)$ with $L(1)=1$. Solution $L(n)=\\\\\\\\Theta(n)$. Total leaf cost $\\\\\\\\Theta(n)$.\\nThus $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n \\\\\\\\lg n)$.\\n\\n## 4.5 The master method for solving recurrences\\nThe master method provides a way to solve recurrences of the form $T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)$, where $a \\\\\\\\ge 1, b > 1$ are constants, and $f(n)$ is an asymptotically positive function.\\nCompare $f(n)$ with the *watershed function* $n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a}$.\\n\\n**Theorem 4.1 (Master Theorem)**\\n1.  If $f(n) = O(n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a - \\\\\\\\epsilon})$ for some constant $\\\\\\\\epsilon > 0$, then $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a})$. (The cost of leaves dominates.)\\n2.  If $f(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a} \\\\\\\\lg^k n)$ for some constant $k \\\\\\\\ge 0$, then $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a} \\\\\\\\lg^{k+1} n)$. (Cost is spread evenly or nearly evenly. If $k=0$, $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a} \\\\\\\\lg n)$.)\\n3.  If $f(n) = \\\\\\\\Omega(n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a + \\\\\\\\epsilon})$ for some constant $\\\\\\\\epsilon > 0$, and if $af(n/b) \\\\\\\\le cf(n)$ for some constant $c < 1$ and all sufficiently large $n$ (the *regularity condition*), then $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(f(n))$. (The cost at the root dominates.)\\n\\n**Examples**:\\n- $T(n) = 9T(n/3) + n$. Here $a=9, b=3$. $n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a} = n^{\\\\\\\\log_3 9} = n^2$. $f(n)=n$. Case 1 applies with $\\\\\\\\epsilon=1$ since $n = O(n^{2-1})$. Solution $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^2)$.\\n- $T(n) = T(2n/3) + 1$. Here $a=1, b=3/2$. $n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a} = n^{\\\\\\\\log_{3/2} 1} = n^0 = 1$. $f(n)=1$. Case 2 applies with $k=0$ since $1 = \\\\\\\\Theta(1 \\ncdot \\\\\\\\lg^0 n)$. Solution $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(\\\\\\\\lg n)$.\\n- $T(n) = 3T(n/4) + n \\\\\\\\lg n$. Here $a=3, b=4$. $n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a} = n^{\\\\\\\\log_4 3} \\\\\\\\approx n^{0.793}$. $f(n) = n \\\\\\\\lg n$. Case 3 applies since $n \\\\\\\\lg n = \\\\\\\\Omega(n^{\\\\\\\\log_4 3 + \\\\\\\\epsilon})$ (e.g., $\\\\\\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\approx 0.2$). Regularity: $3(n/4)\\\\\\\\lg(n/4) \\\\\\\\le (3/4)n \\\\\\\\lg n$. Choose $c=3/4 < 1$. Solution $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n \\\\\\\\lg n)$.\\n- $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n \\\\\\\\lg n$. Here $a=2, b=2$. $n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a} = n^{\\\\\\\\log_2 2} = n$. $f(n) = n \\\\\\\\lg n$. Case 2 applies with $k=1$. Solution $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n \\\\\\\\lg^2 n)$.\\n\\nThe master method does not cover all cases. There are gaps between the cases, e.g., if $f(n)$ is asymptotically larger than $n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a}$ but not polynomially larger. For $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n/\\\\\\\\lg n$, the master method does not apply.\\n\\n## 4.6 Proof of the continuous master theorem (*)\\nThis section proves a version of the master theorem for continuous variables, avoiding floors and ceilings, to illustrate the main ideas. It uses two lemmas.\\n\\n**Lemma 4.2**: For $T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)$ (with $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(1)$ for $0 \\\\\\\\le n < 1$), the solution is $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a}) + \\\\\\\\sum_{j=0}^{\\\\\\\\lfloor \\\\\\\\log_b n \\\\\\\\rfloor} a^j f(n/b^j)$. The first term is leaf costs, the sum is internal node costs from recursion tree.\\n\\n**Lemma 4.3**: This lemma provides bounds for the summation $g(n) = \\\\\\\\sum_{j=0}^{\\\\\\\\lfloor \\\\\\\\log_b n \\\\\\\\rfloor} a^j f(n/b^j)$, corresponding to the three cases of the Master Theorem:\\n1.  If $f(n) = O(n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a - \\\\\\\\epsilon})$, then $g(n) = O(n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a})$.\\n2.  If $f(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a} \\\\\\\\lg^k n)$, then $g(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a} \\\\\\\\lg^{k+1} n)$.\\n3.  If $af(n/b) \\\\\\\\le cf(n)$ for $c<1$ (and $f(n) = \\\\\\\\Omega(n^{\\\\\\\\log_b a + \\\\\\\\epsilon})$ implied by Theorem 4.4 context, though Lemma 4.3 here only needs the regularity for its Case 3 part: $g(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(f(n))$), then $g(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(f(n))$.\\n\\n**Theorem 4.4 (Continuous Master Theorem)**: Formally states the three cases for $T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)$ defined on positive reals with a base case threshold $n_0$. The proof uses auxiliary functions $T'(n) = T(n_0 n)$ and $f'(n) = f(n_0 n)$ to shift the base case to $n < 1$, then applies Lemma 4.2 and Lemma 4.3.\\n\\n## 4.7 Akra-Bazzi recurrences (*)\\nThis method handles recurrences of the form $T(n) = f(n) + \\\\\\\\sum_{i=1}^k a_i T(n/b_i)$, where $a_i > 0, b_i > 1$ are constants, and $f(n)$ is a non-negative driving function.\\n\\n**Polynomial-growth condition**: A function $f(n)$ satisfies this if for any $\\\\\\\\phi \\\\\\\\ge 1$, there exists $d > 1$ such that for all $1 \\\\\\\\le \\\\\\\\psi \\\\\\\\le \\\\\\\\phi$ and $n \\\\\\\\ge \\\\\\\\bar{n}$, $f(n)/d \\\\\\\\le f(\\\\\\\\psi n) \\\\\\\\le df(n)$. This roughly means $f(O(n)) = \\\\\\\\Theta(f(n))$ and implies $f(n)$ is asymptotically positive. Most polynomial and polylogarithmic functions satisfy this.\\n\\n**Theorem 4.5**: If $f(n)$ satisfies the polynomial-growth condition, then floors and ceilings in the arguments $n/b_i$ (e.g., $T(\\\\\\\\lfloor n/b_i \\\\\\\\rfloor)$ or $T(\\\\\\\\lceil n/b_i \\\\\\\\rceil)$) do not affect the asymptotic solution of the Akra-Bazzi recurrence.\\n\\n**The Akra-Bazzi method**:\\n1.  Find the unique real number $p$ such that $\\\\\\\\sum_{i=1}^k a_i / b_i^p = 1$.\\n2.  The solution to the recurrence is $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta \\\\\\\\left( n^p \\\\\\\\left( 1 + \\\\\\\\int_{x_0}^n \\\\\\\\frac{f(x)}{x^{p+1}} dx \\\\\\\\right) \\\\\\\\right)$ for some sufficiently small $x_0$.\\n\\n**Example**: $T(n) = T(n/5) + T(7n/10) + n$. Here $a_1=1, b_1=5, a_2=1, b_2=10/7, f(n)=n$. Find $p$ such that $(1/5)^p + (1/(10/7))^p = (1/5)^p + (7/10)^p = 1$. We find $0 < p < 1$. For example, if $p=0.83978...$, this holds. The integral is $\\\\\\\\int_1^n x/(x^{p+1}) dx = \\\\\\\\int_1^n x^{-p} dx = [x^{-p+1}/(-p+1)]_1^n = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^{1-p})$ since $1-p > 0$.\\nThen $T(n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^p (1 + n^{1-p})) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n^p + n) = \\\\\\\\Theta(n)$ (since $p<1$).\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"file\": \"PartI Foundations/C5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms.md\",\n                \"contents\": \"# 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms\\n\\nThis chapter introduces probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms. Probabilistic analysis uses probability to analyze algorithms, often assuming a distribution for inputs. Randomized algorithms use random numbers to make choices during execution.\\n\\n## 5.1 The hiring problem\\nScenario: Hire a new office assistant. An employment agency sends one candidate per day. Interview, then decide to hire or not. Hiring is costly (fire current, pay agency fee). Goal: always have the best person seen so far.\\nStrategy: Interview candidate $i$. If $i$ is better than current assistant, fire current and hire $i$.\\nCost model: Interview cost $c_i$, hiring cost $c_h$. If $m$ people are hired out of $n$ interviewed, total cost is $O(c_i n + c_h m)$. We focus on the hiring cost $c_h m$.\\nProcedure: [[PartI Foundations Algorithms.md#5.1 HIRE-ASSISTANT]].\\n\\n**Worst-case analysis**: If candidates arrive in increasing order of quality, we hire all $n$ candidates. Total hiring cost is $O(c_h n)$.\\n\\n**Probabilistic analysis**: Assume candidates arrive in a random order. This means each of the $n!$ permutations of candidate ranks (1 to $n$) is equally likely. We analyze the average-case hiring cost.\\n\\n**Randomized algorithms**: If we cannot assume random input order, we can enforce it by randomizing the algorithm. For the hiring problem, we can randomly permute the list of candidates before applying the deterministic hiring strategy. The expected cost is then taken over the algorithm's random choices, not the input distribution.\\n\\n## 5.2 Indicator random variables\\nIndicator random variables provide a convenient way to convert between probabilities and expectations.\\nFor a sample space $S$ and an event $A$, the *indicator random variable* $I\\\\\\\\{A\\\\\\\\}$ is defined as:\\n$I\\\\\\\\{A\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\\\\\text{if } A \\\\\\\\text{ occurs} \\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\\\\\text{if } A \\\\\\\\text{ does not occur} \\\\\\\\end{cases}$\\n\\n**Lemma 5.1**: For an event $A$, $E[I\\\\\\\\{A\\\\\\\\}] = Pr\\\\\\\\{A\\\\\\\\}$.\\nProof: $E[I\\\\\\\\{A\\\\\\\\}] = 1 \\ncdot Pr\\\\\\\\{A\\\\\\\\} + 0 \\ncdot Pr\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\bar{A}\\\\\\\\} = Pr\\\\\\\\{A\\\\\\\\}$.\\n\\nIndicator RVs are useful for analyzing repeated trials. *Linearity of expectation* states that $E[\\\\\\\\sum X_i] = \\\\\\\\sum E[X_i]$, even if $X_i$ are dependent. This is a powerful tool.\\n\\n**Analysis of the hiring problem using indicator random variables**:\\nAssume candidates arrive in a random order.\\nLet $X$ be the random variable for the number of times a new assistant is hired.\\nLet $X_i = I\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\text{candidate } i \\\\\\\\text{ is hired}\\\\\\\\}$.\\nThen $X = X_1 + X_2 + \\nldots + X_n$.\\n$E[X] = E[\\\\\\\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i] = \\\\\\\\sum_{i=1}^n E[X_i]$.\\nCandidate $i$ is hired if candidate $i$ is better than candidates $1, \\nldots, i-1$. Since the first $i$ candidates arrive in a random order, any of these $i$ candidates is equally likely to be the best so far.\\nThus, $Pr\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\text{candidate } i \\\\\\\\text{ is hired}\\\\\\\\} = 1/i$.\\nSo, $E[X_i] = 1/i$.\\n$E[X] = \\\\\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (1/i) = H_n$, the $n$-th harmonic number.\\n$H_n = \\\\\\\\ln n + O(1)$.\\n\\n**Lemma 5.2**: Assuming candidates are presented in a random order, algorithm `HIRE-ASSISTANT` has an average-case total hiring cost of $O(c_h \\\\\\\\ln n)$.\\nThis is a significant improvement over the worst-case $O(c_h n)$.\\n\\n## 5.3 Randomized algorithms\\nInstead of assuming a random input distribution (probabilistic analysis), a randomized algorithm imposes a distribution by making random choices.\\nFor the hiring problem, [[PartI Foundations Algorithms.md#5.3 RANDOMIZED-HIRE-ASSISTANT]] first randomly permutes the list of candidates, then applies the deterministic hiring strategy. Its analysis is identical to the probabilistic analysis of the deterministic algorithm on random inputs.\\n\\n**Lemma 5.3**: The expected hiring cost of `RANDOMIZED-HIRE-ASSISTANT` is $O(c_h \\\\\\\\ln n)$.\\nThis holds for *any* input, as the randomization is part of the algorithm.\\n\\n**Randomly permuting arrays**:\\nA common step in randomized algorithms is to produce a *uniform random permutation* of an input array, where each of the $n!$ permutations is equally likely.\\nProcedure [[PartI Foundations Algorithms.md#5.3 RANDOMLY-PERMUTE]] permutes $A[1..n]$ in place in $\\\\\\\\Theta(n)$ time. In iteration $i$, it swaps $A[i]$ with a random element from $A[i..n]$.\\n\\n**Lemma 5.4**: `RANDOMLY-PERMUTE` computes a uniform random permutation.\\nProof uses a loop invariant:\\n*Loop Invariant*: Prior to the $i$-th iteration, for each possible $(i-1)$-permutation, the subarray $A[1..i-1]$ contains this $(i-1)$-permutation with probability $(n-i+1)!/n!$.\\n- **Initialization** ($i=1$): $A[1..0]$ is empty. There's one 0-permutation (empty). Probability $(n!/n!) = 1$. Holds.\\n- **Maintenance**: Assume invariant holds for $i$. For iteration $i$, let $E_1$ be event that $A[1..i-1]$ is a specific $(i-1)$-permutation $(x_1, \\nldots, x_{i-1})$. $Pr\\\\\\\\{E_1\\\\\\\\} = (n-i+1)!/n!$. Let $E_2$ be event that $A[i]$ gets value $x_i$ (chosen from $n-i+1$ remaining elements). $Pr\\\\\\\\{E_2 | E_1\\\\\\\\} = 1/(n-i+1)$. Probability that $A[1..i]$ is $(x_1, \\nldots, x_i)$ is $Pr\\\\\\\\{E_2 \\ncap E_1\\\\\\\\} = Pr\\\\\\\\{E_2 | E_1\\\\\\\\}Pr\\\\\\\\{E_1\\\\\\\\} = (1/(n-i+1)) \\ncdot ((n-i+1)!/n!) = (n-i)!/n!$. This is the invariant for iteration $i+1$.\\n- **Termination** ($i=n+1$): $A[1..n]$ contains a specific $n$-permutation with probability $(n-(n+1)+1)!/n! = 0!/n! = 1/n!$.\\n\\n## 5.4 Probabilistic analysis and further uses of indicator random variables (*)\\nThis section presents more examples of probabilistic analysis.\\n\\n### 5.4.1 The birthday paradox\\nHow many people $k$ must be in a room for a $>50\\\\\\\\%$ chance that at least two share a birthday? Assume $n=365$ days, birthdays are independent and uniformly distributed.\\n- **Analysis via complementary event**: Let $B_k$ be event that $k$ people have distinct birthdays. $Pr\\\\\\\\{B_k\\\\\\\\} = Pr\\\\\\\\{B_{k-1}\\\\\\\\}Pr\\\\\\\\{A_k|B_{k-1}\\\\\\\\}$, where $A_k$ is event that person $k$'s birthday is different from first $k-1$. $Pr\\\\\\\\{A_k|B_{k-1}\\\\\\\\} = (n-k+1)/n$. So $Pr\\\\\\\\{B_k\\\\\\\\} = 1 \\ncdot \\\\\\\\frac{n-1}{n} \\ncdot \\\\\\\\frac{n-2}{n} \\ncdots \\\\\\\\frac{n-k+1}{n}$. Using $1+x \\\\\\\\le e^x$, $Pr\\\\\\\\{B_k\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\le e^{-k(k-1)/(2n)}$. This is $\\\\\\\\le 1/2$ when $k(k-1) \\\\\\\\ge 2n \\\\\\\\ln 2$. For $n=365$, $k \\\\\\\\ge 23$.\\n- **Analysis using indicator RVs**: Let $X_{ij} = I\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\text{person } i \\\\\\\\text{ and } j \\\\\\\\text{ share a birthday}\\\\\\\\}$ for $1 \\\\\\\\le i < j \\\\\\\\le k$. $Pr\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\text{persons } i,j \\\\\\\\text{ share birthday}\\\\\\\\} = 1/n$. $E[X_{ij}] = 1/n$. Let $X$ be total pairs with same birthday. $X = \\\\\\\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \\\\\\\\sum_{j=i+1}^k X_{ij}$. $E[X] = \\\\\\\\binom{k}{2} (1/n) = k(k-1)/(2n)$. We expect $E[X]=1$ when $k(k-1) = 2n$, so $k \\\\\\\\approx \\\\\\\\sqrt{2n}$. For $n=365, k \\\\\\\\approx 28$. Both analyses yield $k = \\\\\\\\Theta(\\\\\\\\sqrt{n})$.\\n\\n### 5.4.2 Balls and bins\\nRandomly toss $n_{balls}$ identical balls into $b$ bins. Tosses are independent, each bin equally likely ($1/b$).\\n- **Expected balls in a given bin**: If $n_{balls}$ are tossed, this is $n_{balls}/b$.\\n- **Expected tosses until a given bin contains a ball**: This follows a geometric distribution with success probability $1/b$. Expected tosses = $b$.\\n- **Expected tosses until every bin contains at least one ball (Coupon Collector's Problem)**: Let $n_i$ be tosses for $i$-th stage (after $(i-1)$-th hit until $i$-th hit). Probability of hit in stage $i$ is $(b-i+1)/b$. $E[n_i] = b/(b-i+1)$. Total expected tosses $N = \\\\\\\\sum_{i=1}^b E[n_i] = \\\\\\\\sum_{i=1}^b b/(b-i+1) = b \\\\\\\\sum_{j=1}^b (1/j) = b H_b \\\\\\\\approx b \\\\\\\\ln b$.\\n\\n### 5.4.3 Streaks\\nLongest streak of consecutive heads in $n$ fair coin flips.\\n- **Expected length is $O(\\\\\\\\lg n)$**: Let $A_{ik}$ be event that streak of $\\\\\\\\ge k$ heads starts at $i$-th flip. $Pr\\\\\\\\{A_{ik}\\\\\\\\} = 1/2^k$. For $k = 2\\\\\\\\lceil \\\\\\\\lg n \\\\\\\\rceil$, $Pr\\\\\\\\{A_{i,2\\\\\\\\lceil \\\\\\\\lg n \\\\\\\\rceil}\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\le 1/n^2$. Probability any such streak starts $\\\\\\\\le n \\ncdot (1/n^2) = 1/n$. Let $L$ be length of longest streak. $E[L] = \\\\\\\\sum j Pr\\\\\\\\{L_j\\\\\\\\}$. By splitting sum at $2\\\\\\\\lceil \\\\\\\\lg n \\\\\\\\rceil$, $E[L] < 2\\\\\\\\lceil \\\\\\\\lg n \\\\\\\\rceil \\ncdot 1 + n \\ncdot (1/n) = O(\\\\\\\\lg n)$.\\n- **Expected length is $\\\\\\\\Omega(\\\\\\\\lg n)$**: Partition $n$ flips into $\\\\\\\\approx n/s$ groups of $s$ flips. Choose $s = \\\\\\\\lfloor (\\\\\\\\lg n)/2 \\\\\\\\rfloor$. Probability a specific group is all heads is $1/2^s \\\\\\\\ge 1/\\\\\\\\sqrt{n}$. Probability no group is all heads $\\\\\\\\le (1-1/\\\\\\\\sqrt{n})^{n/s} \\\\\\\\approx e^{-(n/s)/\\\\\\\\sqrt{n}} = O(1/n)$. So, with high probability, at least one streak of length $s = \\\\\\\\Omega(\\\\\\\\lg n)$ occurs. This implies $E[L] = \\\\\\\\Omega(\\\\\\\\lg n)$.\\nThus, longest expected streak is $\\\\\\\\Theta(\\\\\\\\lg n)$.\\n\\n### 5.4.4 The online hiring problem\\nGoal: Hire exactly once. Strategy: Interview and reject first $k$ candidates. Then hire the first subsequent candidate who is better than all $k$ initial candidates. If no such candidate appears, hire the $n$-th candidate.\\nProcedure: [[PartI Foundations Algorithms.md#5.4 ONLINE-MAXIMUM]].\\nLet $S$ be event of successfully hiring the best overall candidate.

Each is usually part of a collection of data called a **record**. Each record contains a **key**, which is the value to be sorted. The remainder of the record consists of **satellite data**. Sorting algorithms typically permute keys and must permute satellite data as well. If satellite data is large, permuting an array of pointers to the records is often more efficient than permuting the records themselves to minimize data movement.\\nA sorting algorithm describes the *method* to determine the sorted order, regardless of whether sorting individual numbers or large records. We typically assume input consists only of numbers for simplicity.\\n\\n### Why sorting?\\nMany computer scientists consider sorting to be the most fundamental problem in the study of algorithms for several reasons:\\n- Applications inherently need to sort information (e.g., banks sorting checks by number for customer statements).\\n- Algorithms often use sorting as a key subroutine (e.g., rendering graphical objects layered on top of each other).\\n- A wide variety of sorting algorithms exist, employing a rich set of techniques. Many important techniques used throughout algorithm design appear in sorting algorithms developed over the years.\\n- We can prove nontrivial lower bounds for sorting. Since the best upper bounds match the lower bound asymptotically, certain sorting algorithms are asymptotically optimal. Moreover, the lower bound for sorting can be used to prove lower bounds for various other problems.\\n- Many engineering issues come to the fore when implementing sorting algorithms, depending on factors like prior knowledge about keys and satellite data, memory hierarchy, and software environment.\\n\\n### Overview of Algorithms in Part II\\nThis part introduces several sorting algorithms and algorithms for order statistics.\\n\\n#### Sorting Algorithms\\n- **Comparison sorts** determine the sorted order of an input array by comparing elements.\\n    - **Heapsort** (Chapter 6): Sorts $n$ numbers in place in $O(n \\\\lg n)$ time. It uses an important data structure called a heap.\\n    - **Quicksort** (Chapter 7): Also sorts $n$ numbers in place. Its worst-case running time is $\\\\Theta(n^2)$, but its expected running time is $O(n \\\\lg n)$ and it generally outperforms heapsort in practice.\\n- Chapter 8 introduces the decision-tree model to study performance limitations of comparison sorts, proving an $\\\\Omega(n \\\\lg n)$ lower bound on their worst-case running time.\\n- **Linear-time sorts** (Chapter 8): These algorithms are not comparison sorts and can achieve better performance under certain assumptions.\\n    - **Counting sort**: Assumes input numbers belong to the set $\\\\{0, 1, \\\\ldots, k\\\\}$. It sorts $n$ numbers in $\\\\Theta(k+n)$ time.\\n    - **Radix sort**: Extends counting sort. If there are $n$ integers to sort, each integer has $d$ digits, and each digit can take on up to $k$ possible values, radix sort sorts the numbers in $\\\\Theta(d(n+k))$ time.\\n    - **Bucket sort**: Requires knowledge of the probabilistic distribution of numbers in the input array. It can sort $n$ real numbers uniformly distributed in the half-open interval $[0, 1)$ in average-case $O(n)$ time.\\nA table on page 160 (OCR page 5) summarizes the running times of these algorithms.\\n\\n#### Order Statistics (Chapter 9)\\nThe $i$-th order statistic of a set of $n$ numbers is the $i$-th smallest number in the set.\\nChapter 9 shows how to find the $i$-th smallest element in $O(n)$ time, even when elements are arbitrary real numbers. It presents a randomized algorithm with $O(n)$ expected time and a more complicated algorithm that runs in $O(n)$ worst-case time.\\n\\n### Background\\nAnalyses of quicksort, bucket sort, and the order-statistic algorithm use probability, which is reviewed in Appendix C, and material on probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms from Chapter 5.\\n\\n---\\n# 6 Heapsort\\n## Introduction (Chapter 6 Introduction)\\nThis chapter introduces heapsort. Like merge sort, but unlike insertion sort, heapsort's running time is $O(n \\\\lg n)$. Like insertion sort, but unlike merge sort, heapsort sorts in place: only a constant number of array elements are stored outside the input array at any time. Thus, heapsort combines better attributes of the two sorting algorithms already discussed.\\nHeapsort also introduces using a data structure (a \\\"heap\\\") to manage information. The heap data structure is useful for heapsort and for making an efficient priority queue. The term \\\"heap\\\" in this context refers to the data structure, not to garbage-collected storage common in languages like Java and Python.\\n\\n## 6.1 Heaps\\nThe (binary) **heap** data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree (see Section B.5.3), as shown in Figure 6.1 of the book. Each node of the tree corresponds to an element of the array. The tree is completely filled on all levels except possibly the lowest, which is filled from the left up to a point.\\nAn array $A[1 \\\\ldots n]$ that represents a heap is an object with an attribute `A.heap-size`, which represents how many elements in the heap are stored within array $A$. That is, although $A[1 \\\\ldots n]$ may contain numbers, only the elements in $A[1 \\\\ldots \\\\text{A.heap-size}]$, where $0 \\\\le \\\\text{A.heap-size} \\\\le n$, are valid elements of the heap. If `A.heap-size` = 0, the heap is empty. The root of the tree is $A[1]$.\\nGiven the index $i$ of a node:\\n- `PARENT(i)` returns $\\\\lfloor i/2 \\\\rfloor$. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C6.1 PARENT(i)]].\\n- `LEFT(i)` returns $2i$. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C6.1 LEFT(i)]].\\n- `RIGHT(i)` returns $2i+1$. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C6.1 RIGHT(i)]].\\nThese operations can be computed efficiently, often using bit shifts.\\n\\nThere are two kinds of binary heaps: max-heaps and min-heaps. In both kinds, the values in the nodes satisfy a **heap property**.\\n- In a **max-heap**, the **max-heap property** is that for every node $i$ other than the root, $A[\\\\text{PARENT}(i)] \\\\ge A[i]$. Thus, the largest element in a max-heap is stored at the root, and the subtree rooted at a node contains values no larger than that contained at the node itself.\\n- In a **min-heap**, the **min-heap property** is that for every node $i$ other than the root, $A[\\\\text{PARENT}(i)] \\\\le A[i]$. The smallest element in a min-heap is at the root.\\nThe heapsort algorithm uses max-heaps. Min-heaps commonly implement priority queues.\\n\\nThe **height** of a node in a heap is the number of edges on the longest simple downward path from the node to a leaf. The **height of the heap** is the height of its root. Since a heap of $n$ elements is based on a complete binary tree, its height is $\\\\Theta(\\\\lg n)$ (see Exercise 6.1-2). Basic operations on heaps run in time at most proportional to the height of the tree, and thus take $O(\\\\lg n)$ time.\\nThis chapter presents:\\n- The `MAX-HEAPIFY` procedure, which runs in $O(\\\\lg n)$ time, key to maintaining the max-heap property.\\n- The `BUILD-MAX-HEAP` procedure, which runs in linear time, produces a max-heap from an unordered input array.\\n- The `HEAPSORT` procedure, which runs in $O(n \\\\lg n)$ time, sorts an array in place.\\n- Procedures for implementing a priority queue using a heap.\\n\\n## 6.2 Maintaining the heap property\\nThe procedure `MAX-HEAPIFY` maintains the max-heap property. Its inputs are an array $A$ and an index $i$ into the array. When it is called, `MAX-HEAPIFY` assumes that the binary trees rooted at `LEFT(i)` and `RIGHT(i)` are max-heaps, but that $A[i]$ might be smaller than its children, thus violating the max-heap property. `MAX-HEAPIFY` lets the value at $A[i]$ \\\"float down\\\" in the max-heap so that the subtree rooted at index $i$ obeys the max-heap property. Figure 6.2 of the book illustrates its action. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C6.2 MAX-HEAPIFY(A, i)]].\\nTo analyze `MAX-HEAPIFY`, let $T(n)$ be the worst-case running time on a subtree of size at most $n$. The running time is $\\\\Theta(1)$ to fix relationships among $A[i]$, $A[\\\\text{LEFT}(i)]$, and $A[\\\\text{RIGHT}(i)]$, plus time to run `MAX-HEAPIFY` on a child's subtree. Children's subtrees each have size at most $2n/3$. The recurrence is $T(n) \\\\le T(2n/3) + \\\\Theta(1)$. By case 2 of the master theorem, the solution is $T(n) = O(\\\\lg n)$. Alternatively, running time on a node of height $h$ is $O(h)$.\\n\\n## 6.3 Building a heap\\nThe procedure `BUILD-MAX-HEAP` converts an array $A[1 \\\\ldots n]$ into a max-heap by calling `MAX-HEAPIFY` in a bottom-up manner. Elements in $A[\\\\lfloor n/2 \\\\rfloor + 1 \\\\ldots n]$ are leaves, so each is a 1-element heap. `BUILD-MAX-HEAP` iterates through remaining nodes and runs `MAX-HEAPIFY` on each. Figure 6.3 of the book shows an example. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C6.3 BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A, n)]].\\nCorrectness uses a loop invariant:\\n- **Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the `for` loop (lines 2-3), each node $i+1, i+2, \\\\ldots, n$ is the root of a max-heap.\\n- **Initialization**: Prior to first iteration, $i = \\\\lfloor n/2 \\\\rfloor$. Nodes $\\\\lfloor n/2 \\\\rfloor + 1, \\\\ldots, n$ are leaves, thus roots of trivial max-heaps.\\n- **Maintenance**: Children of node $i$ are numbered higher than $i$. By loop invariant, they are roots of max-heaps. This is the condition for `MAX-HEAPIFY(A, i)` to make node $i$ a max-heap root. `MAX-HEAPIFY` preserves property for nodes $i+1, \\\\ldots, n$. Decrementing $i$ reestablishes invariant for next iteration.\\n- **Termination**: Loop terminates when $i=0$. Each node $1, \\\\ldots, n$ is root of a max-heap. Node 1 is root of the overall max-heap.\\nA simple upper bound on running time is $O(n \\\\lg n)$ ($O(n)$ calls to `MAX-HEAPIFY`, each $O(\\\\lg n)$). A tighter bound observes that time for `MAX-HEAPIFY` varies with node height. An $n$-element heap has height $\\\\lfloor \\\\lg n \\\\rfloor$ and at most $\\\\lceil n/2^{h+1} \\\\rceil$ nodes of any height $h$. Time for `MAX-HEAPIFY` on a node of height $h$ is $O(h)$. Total cost is bounded by $\\\\sum_{h=0}^{\\\\lfloor \\\\lg n \\\\rfloor} \\\\lceil n/2^{h+1} \\\\rceil O(h) = O(n \\\\sum_{h=0}^{\\\\lfloor \\\\lg n \\\\rfloor} h/2^h) = O(n)$. Thus, `BUILD-MAX-HEAP` takes $O(n)$ time.\\nTo build a min-heap, use `BUILD-MIN-HEAP` with `MIN-HEAPIFY`.\\n\\n## 6.4 The heapsort algorithm\\nThe `HEAPSORT` algorithm starts by calling `BUILD-MAX-HEAP` to build a max-heap on the input array $A[1 \\\\ldots n]$. Since $A[1]$ is the maximum element, it is placed in its correct final position by exchanging it with $A[n]$. Node $n$ is then discarded from the heap (by decrementing `A.heap-size`). The children of the root remain max-heaps, but the new root might violate the max-heap property. `MAX-HEAPIFY(A,1)` restores it. This process repeats for max-heaps of size $n-1$ down to 2. Figure 6.4 of the book shows an example. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C6.4 HEAPSORT(A, n)]].\\nThe `HEAPSORT` procedure takes $O(n \\\\lg n)$ time, since `BUILD-MAX-HEAP` takes $O(n)$ time and each of the $n-1$ calls to `MAX-HEAPIFY` takes $O(\\\\lg n)$ time.\\n\\n## 6.5 Priority queues\\nA **priority queue** is a data structure for maintaining a set $S$ of elements, each with an associated value called a key. A **max-priority queue** supports operations:\\n- `INSERT(S, x, k)`: inserts element $x$ with key $k$ into $S$.\\n- `MAXIMUM(S)`: returns element of $S$ with largest key.\\n- `EXTRACT-MAX(S)`: removes and returns element of $S$ with largest key.\\n- `INCREASE-KEY(S, x, k)`: increases value of element $x$'s key to new value $k$.\\nApplications include job scheduling. A **min-priority queue** supports `INSERT`, `MINIMUM`, `EXTRACT-MIN`, `DECREASE-KEY`. Applications include event-driven simulators.\\nHeaps can implement priority queues. `MAX-HEAP-MAXIMUM` takes $\\\\Theta(1)$ time. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C6.5 MAX-HEAP-MAXIMUM(A)]].\\n`MAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX` is similar to the loop body of `HEAPSORT`. Running time is $O(\\\\lg n)$. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C6.5 MAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX(A)]].\\n`MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY` updates an element's key. If the new key violates the max-heap property, it traverses up the tree, exchanging with parent if element's key is larger, until max-heap property holds. Running time on an $n$-element heap is $O(\\\\lg n)$. Figure 6.5 of the book shows an example. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C6.5 MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY(A, x, k)]].\\n`MAX-HEAP-INSERT` expands the max-heap, adds new leaf with key $-\\\\infty$, then calls `MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY`. Running time on an $n$-element heap is $O(\\\\lg n)$. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C6.5 MAX-HEAP-INSERT(A, x, n)]].\\nIn summary, a heap supports priority-queue operations on a set of size $n$ in $O(\\\\lg n)$ time, plus mapping overhead if applicable.\\n\\n## Problems\\nChapter 6 problems include topics such as: Building a heap using insertion, Analysis of d-ary heaps, Young tableaus.\\n\\n## Chapter notes\\nThe heapsort algorithm was invented by Williams (1964). `BUILD-MAX-HEAP` was suggested by Floyd (1964). Schaffer and Sedgewick (1993) analyzed element movements in heapsort. More complex data structures like Fibonacci heaps offer better amortized times for some priority queue operations. Other advanced heaps exist if keys are integers or drawn from specific sets.\\n\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"file\": \"PartII Sorting and Order Statistics/C7 Quicksort.md\",\n                \"contents\": \"# 7 Quicksort\\n## Introduction\\nQuicksort has a worst-case running time of $\\\\Theta(n^2)$ on an input array of $n$ numbers. Despite this, quicksort is often the best practical choice for sorting because it is remarkably efficient on average: its expected running time is $O(n \\\\lg n)$ when all numbers are distinct, and the constant factors hidden in the $O(n \\\\lg n)$ notation are small. Unlike merge sort, it also has the advantage of sorting in place, and it works well even in virtual-memory environments.\\n\\n## 7.1 Description of quicksort\\nQuicksort, like merge sort, applies the divide-and-conquer method.\\nIn the divide-and-conquer method for sorting subarray $A[p \\\\ldots r]$:\\n- **Divide**: Partition (rearrange) $A[p \\\\ldots r]$ into two (possibly empty) subarrays $A[p \\\\ldots q-1]$ (low side) and $A[q+1 \\\\ldots r]$ (high side) such that each element in the low side is $\\\\le$ the pivot $A[q]$, which is, in turn, $\\\\le$ each element in the high side. Compute index $q$ as part of partitioning.\\n- **Conquer**: Call quicksort recursively to sort $A[p \\\\ldots q-1]$ and $A[q+1 \\\\ldots r]$.\\n- **Combine**: Do nothing. The subarrays are sorted in place, and after conquering, the entire $A[p \\\\ldots r]$ is sorted.\\nRefer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C7.1 QUICKSORT(A, p, r)]] for the `QUICKSORT` procedure. To sort an entire $n$-element array $A[1 \\\\ldots n]$, the initial call is `QUICKSORT(A, 1, n)`.\\n\\n### Partitioning the array\\nThe key is the `PARTITION` procedure, which rearranges $A[p \\\\ldots r]$ in place. `PARTITION` always selects $x = A[r]$ as the pivot. As it runs, elements fall into one of four regions. Figure 7.2 of the book shows these regions. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C7.1 PARTITION(A, p, r)]].\\nCorrectness of `PARTITION` uses a loop invariant for the `for` loop (lines 3-6):\\nAt the beginning of each iteration, for any array index $k$:\\n1. If $p \\\\le k \\\\le i$, then $A[k] \\\\le x$.\\n2. If $i+1 \\\\le k \\\\le j-1$, then $A[k] > x$.\\n3. If $k=r$, then $A[k]=x$.\\n- **Initialization**: Before the first loop iteration, $i=p-1$ and $j=p$. Regions for conditions 1 and 2 are empty. Condition 3 holds by $A[r]=x$.\\n- **Maintenance**: If $A[j] > x$, only $j$ increments, maintaining condition 2 for $A[j-1]$. If $A[j] \\\\le x$, $i$ increments, $A[i]$ and $A[j]$ swap, then $j$ increments. This maintains condition 1 for new $A[i]$ and condition 2 for $A[j-1]$.\\n- **Termination**: Loop terminates when $j=r$. All elements are partitioned into three sets: those $\\\\le x$, those $> x$, and the pivot $x$. The final swap (line 7) places pivot $x$ into its correct sorted position. The procedure returns the pivot's new index.\\nThe running time of `PARTITION` on a subarray of $n=r-p+1$ elements is $\\\\Theta(n)$.\\n\\n## 7.2 Performance of quicksort\\nRunning time depends on how balanced partitioning is, which depends on pivot choice. If balanced, it's as fast as merge sort. If unbalanced, as slow as insertion sort. Quicksort's memory use (stack depth for recursion) is not constant, could be $O(n)$ worst-case.\\n\\n### Worst-case partitioning\\nOccurs if partitioning produces one subproblem with $n-1$ elements and one with 0 elements. Recurrence: $T(n) = T(n-1) + T(0) + \\\\Theta(n) = T(n-1) + \\\\Theta(n)$. Solution is $T(n) = \\\\Theta(n^2)$. This happens if input array is already sorted and $A[r]$ is always chosen as pivot.\\n\\n### Best-case partitioning\\nIf `PARTITION` produces two subproblems, each of size no more than $n/2$. Recurrence: $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \\\\Theta(n)$. Solution is $T(n) = \\\\Theta(n \\\\lg n)$.\\n\\n### Balanced partitioning\\nEven a constant-proportional split (e.g., 9-to-1) yields $O(n \\\\lg n)$ running time. If $T(n) = T(9n/10) + T(n/10) + \\\\Theta(n)$, the recursion tree depth is $\\\\Theta(\\\\lg n)$ and cost per level is $O(n)$, so total $O(n \\\\lg n)$. Figure 7.4 of the book illustrates this.\\n\\n### Intuition for the average case\\nAssuming all permutations of input numbers are equally likely and elements are distinct. Partitioning is unlikely to be same way at every level. A mix of \\\"good\\\" (balanced) and \\\"bad\\\" (unbalanced) splits occurs. Even if good and bad splits alternate, the cost of a bad split can be absorbed into the cost of a subsequent good split, yielding $O(n \\\\lg n)$ overall. Figure 7.5 of the book shows this.\\n\\n## 7.3 A randomized version of quicksort\\nTo obtain good expected performance over all inputs, we randomize the algorithm. Instead of always using $A[r]$ as pivot, `RANDOMIZED-PARTITION` randomly chooses a pivot from subarray $A[p \\\\ldots r]$ and exchanges it with $A[r]$ before partitioning. This ensures the pivot is equally likely to be any element, making the split well-balanced on average. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C7.3 RANDOMIZED-PARTITION(A, p, r)]] and [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C7.3 RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT(A, p, r)]].\\n\\n## 7.4 Analysis of quicksort\\n### 7.4.1 Worst-case analysis\\nApplies to both `QUICKSORT` and `RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT`. The recurrence for worst-case time is $T(n) = \\\\max_{0 \\\\le q \\\\le n-1} \\\\{T(q) + T(n-1-q)\\\\} + \\\\Theta(n)$. The expression $q^2 + (n-1-q)^2$ is maximized when $q=0$ or $q=n-1$. The solution is $T(n) = \\\\Theta(n^2)$.\\n\\n### 7.4.2 Expected running time\\nAnalysis for `RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT`, assuming distinct elements. Let elements be $z_1 < z_2 < \\\\ldots < z_n$ in sorted order.\\n**Running time and comparisons**: Lemma 7.1 states running time is $O(n+X)$, where $X$ is total element comparisons.\\n**When elements are compared**: Lemma 7.2 states $z_i$ is compared with $z_j$ (for $i<j$) if and only if $z_i$ or $z_j$ is the first element chosen as a pivot from the set $Z_{ij} = \\\\{z_i, z_{i+1}, \\\\ldots, z_j\\\\}$. No two elements are compared more than once.\\n**Probability of comparison**: Lemma 7.3 states $Pr\\\\{z_i \\\\text{ is compared with } z_j\\\\} = 2/(j-i+1)$. This is because $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared iff one of them is chosen as the first pivot from $Z_{ij}$. Any element in $Z_{ij}$ is equally likely to be chosen first, and there are $j-i+1$ elements in $Z_{ij}$.\\n**Expected number of comparisons**: Theorem 7.4 states expected running time is $O(n \\\\lg n)$.\\nLet $X_{ij} = I\\\\{z_i \\\\text{ is compared with } z_j\\\\}$. Total comparisons $X = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n X_{ij}$.\\n$E[X] = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n E[X_{ij}] = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n Pr\\\\{z_i \\\\text{ is compared with } z_j\\\\} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^n \\\\frac{2}{j-i+1}$.\\nChanging variables $k=j-i$, $E[X] = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-i} \\\\frac{2}{k+1} < \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\\\frac{2}{k} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} O(\\\\lg n) = O(n \\\\lg n)$.\\nThus, expected running time is $O(n \\\\lg n)$.\\n\\n## Problems\\nChapter 7 problems include topics such as: Hoare partition correctness (see [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C7.P7-1 HOARE-PARTITION(A, p, r)]]), Quicksort with equal element values, Alternative quicksort analysis, Stooge sort (see [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C7.P7-4 STOOGE-SORT(A, p, r)]]), Stack depth for quicksort (see [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C7.P7-5 TRE-QUICKSORT(A, p, r)]]), Median-of-3 partition, Fuzzy sorting of intervals.\\n\\n## Chapter notes\\nQuicksort was invented by Hoare (1961). The `PARTITION` procedure in Section 7.1 is attributed to N. Lomuto. The expected time analysis is based on Motwani and Raghavan. McIlroy showed how to create inputs that cause most quicksort implementations to take $\\\\Theta(n^2)$ time.\\n\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"file\": \"PartII Sorting and Order Statistics/C8 Sorting in Linear Time.md\",\n                \"contents\": \"# 8 Sorting in Linear Time\\n## Introduction\\nMerge sort and heapsort achieve $O(n \\\\lg n)$ worst-case time. Quicksort achieves $O(n \\\\lg n)$ expected time. These algorithms are **comparison sorts**: they determine sorted order based only on comparisons between input elements. This chapter proves that any comparison sort must make $\\\\Omega(n \\\\lg n)$ comparisons in the worst case. Thus, merge sort and heapsort are asymptotically optimal.\\nThis chapter also examines three algorithms\\u2014counting sort, radix sort, and bucket sort\\u2014that run in linear time on certain inputs. These algorithms use operations other than comparisons, so the $\\\\Omega(n \\\\lg n)$ lower bound does not apply.\\n\\n## 8.1 Lower bounds for sorting\\nA **comparison sort** uses only comparisons ($<, \\\\le, =, \\\\ge, >$) between elements to gain order information. Assume all input elements are distinct, simplifying comparisons to, e.g., $a_i \\\\le a_j$.\\n\\n### The decision-tree model\\nComparison sorts can be viewed abstractly as **decision trees**. A decision tree is a full binary tree representing comparisons for a particular algorithm on an input of fixed size $n$. Internal nodes are annotated $i:j$, representing comparison $a_i \\\\le a_j$. Left child path is taken if $a_i \\\\le a_j$, right if $a_i > a_j$. Leaves are annotated with a permutation $\\\\langle \\\\pi(1), \\\\ldots, \\\\pi(n) \\\\rangle$ indicating the sorted order $a_{\\\\pi(1)} \\\\le \\\\ldots \\\\le a_{\\\\pi(n)}$. Figure 8.1 of the book shows an example for insertion sort on 3 elements.\\nFor a correct sorting algorithm, each of the $n!$ permutations must appear as at least one reachable leaf.\\n\\n### A lower bound for the worst case\\nThe length of the longest path from root to any reachable leaf is the worst-case number of comparisons. This is the height $h$ of the decision tree.\\n**Theorem 8.1**: Any comparison sort algorithm requires $\\\\Omega(n \\\\lg n)$ comparisons in the worst case.\\n*Proof*: A decision tree of height $h$ has at most $2^h$ leaves. Since there are $n!$ possible permutations and each must be a reachable leaf, $n! \\\\le l \\\\le 2^h$, where $l$ is number of leaves. Thus $h \\\\ge \\\\lg(n!)$. Using Stirling's approximation or $\\\\lg(n!) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\lg k = \\\\Omega(n \\\\lg n)$ (Equation 3.28), $h = \\\\Omega(n \\\\lg n)$.\\n**Corollary 8.2**: Heapsort and merge sort are asymptotically optimal comparison sorts.\\n*Proof*: Their $O(n \\\\lg n)$ upper bounds match the $\\\\Omega(n \\\\lg n)$ lower bound.\\n\\n## 8.2 Counting sort\\nCounting sort assumes each of the $n$ input elements is an integer in the range $0$ to $k$. It runs in $\\\\Theta(n+k)$ time. If $k=O(n)$, it runs in $\\\\Theta(n)$ time.\\nCounting sort determines for each input element $x$, the number of elements $\\\\le x$. It uses this to place $x$ directly into its output position. It modifies this to handle duplicate values correctly. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C8.2 COUNTING-SORT(A, n, k)]]. Figure 8.2 of the book illustrates its operation.\\n1. Initialize count array $C[0 \\\\ldots k]$ to zeros (lines 2-3, $\\\\Theta(k)$ time).\\n2. Count occurrences of each element $A[j]$ into $C[A[j]]$ (lines 4-5, $\\\\Theta(n)$ time).\\n3. Compute cumulative counts: $C[i]$ stores number of elements $\\\\le i$ (lines 7-8, $\\\\Theta(k)$ time).\\n4. Place elements from $A$ into sorted positions in output array $B$, iterating $A$ in reverse. $C[A[j]]$ is correct position for $A[j]$. Decrement $C[A[j]]$ after placing to handle duplicates (lines 11-13, $\\\\Theta(n)$ time).\\nOverall time: $\\\\Theta(n+k)$.\\nCounting sort is **stable**: elements with the same value appear in the output array in the same order as in the input array. Stability is important, e.g., when used as subroutine in radix sort.\\n\\n## 8.3 Radix sort\\nRadix sort is used by card-sorting machines. It sorts on the least significant digit first. It requires the digit sort to be stable.\\nExample: Sorting 3-digit numbers. Sort by 1s digit, then 10s digit, then 100s digit, using a stable sort each time. Figure 8.3 of the book shows an example.\\nRefer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C8.3 RADIX-SORT(A, n, d)]] for procedure `RADIX-SORT(A, n, d)` which sorts $n$ $d$-digit numbers.\\n**Lemma 8.3**: Given $n$ $d$-digit numbers where each digit takes $k$ possible values, `RADIX-SORT` correctly sorts in $\\\\Theta(d(n+k))$ time if the stable sort takes $\\\\Theta(n+k)$ time (e.g., counting sort).\\n*Proof*: Correctness by induction on digit sorted. Running time is $d$ passes of counting sort.\\nFor $n$ $b$-bit numbers, we can view each key as $d = \\\\lceil b/r \\\\rceil$ digits of $r$ bits each. Each $r$-bit digit is an integer in $0 \\\\ldots 2^r-1$. So $k=2^r-1$. Counting sort takes $\\\\Theta(n+2^r)$ per pass.\\n**Lemma 8.4**: `RADIX-SORT` on $n$ $b$-bit numbers using $r$-bit digits takes $\\\\Theta((b/r)(n+2^r))$ time.\\n- If $b < \\\\lceil \\\\lg n \\\\rceil$, choosing $r=b$ gives $\\\\Theta(n)$ time.\\n- If $b \\\\ge \\\\lceil \\\\lg n \\\\rceil$, choosing $r = \\\\lceil \\\\lg n \\\\rceil$ gives $\\\\Theta( (b/\\\\lg n)(n + 2^{\\\\lg n}) ) = \\\\Theta(bn/\\\\lg n)$ time.\\nRadix sort is not always better than comparison sorts like quicksort due to constant factors and cache performance. It's generally not in-place if counting sort is used.\\n\\n## 8.4 Bucket sort\\nBucket sort assumes input is drawn from a uniform distribution over $[0,1)$ and has an average-case running time of $O(n)$.\\nIt divides $[0,1)$ into $n$ equal-sized subintervals (buckets). It distributes $n$ input numbers into buckets. Since inputs are uniform, few numbers are expected per bucket. It then sorts numbers in each bucket (e.g., with insertion sort) and concatenates sorted buckets. Figure 8.4 of the book shows an example. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C8.4 BUCKET-SORT(A, n)]].\\nCorrectness: If $A[i] \\\\le A[j]$, then $\\\\lfloor n A[i] \\\\rfloor \\\\le \\\\lfloor n A[j] \\\\rfloor$. If they are in same bucket, insertion sort orders them. If different buckets, concatenation orders them.\\nAnalysis:\\n- Lines 1-5 and 8-9 take $O(n)$ time.\\n- Line 7 (sorting buckets): Let $n_i$ be random variable for number of elements in bucket $B[i]$. Insertion sort is $O(n_i^2)$. Total time $T(n) = \\\\Theta(n) + \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} O(n_i^2)$.\\n- Average case: $E[T(n)] = \\\\Theta(n) + \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} O(E[n_i^2])$.\\n- For $n_i \\\\sim B(n, p=1/n)$, $E[n_i] = np = 1$, $Var[n_i] = np(1-p) = 1-1/n$. $E[n_i^2] = Var[n_i] + (E[n_i])^2 = (1-1/n) + 1^2 = 2-1/n$.\\n- So $E[T(n)] = \\\\Theta(n) + n \\\\cdot O(2-1/n) = \\\\Theta(n)$.\\nWorst-case time is $\\\\Theta(n^2)$ if all elements fall into one bucket. Can be improved to $O(n \\\\lg n)$ worst-case by using merge sort for buckets.\\nBucket sort runs in linear time if sum of squares of bucket sizes is linear in total elements.\\n\\n## Problems\\nChapter 8 problems include topics such as: Probabilistic lower bounds on comparison sorting, Sorting in place in linear time, Sorting variable-length items, Water jugs, Average sorting, Lower bound on merging sorted lists, The 0-1 sorting lemma and columnsort (includes [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C8.P8-7 COMPARE-EXCHANGE(A, i, j)]] and [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C8.P8-7 COMPARE-EXCHANGE-INSERTION-SORT(A, n)]]).\\n\\n## Chapter notes\\nDecision-tree model by Ford and Johnson (1959).

The minimum is the 1st order statistic ($i=1$), maximum is the $n$-th order statistic ($i=n$). A **median** is informally the \\\"halfway point\\\". If $n$ is odd, unique median at $i=(n+1)/2$. If $n$ is even, two medians: lower median at $i=n/2$, upper median at $i=n/2+1$. We typically refer to the lower median as \\\"the median\\\", occurring at $i = \\\\lfloor (n+1)/2 \\\\rfloor$. This chapter addresses selecting the $i$-th order statistic from $n$ distinct numbers.\\n**Selection Problem**:\\n- **Input**: A set $A$ of $n$ distinct numbers and an integer $i$, $1 \\\\le i \\\\le n$.\\n- **Output**: The element $x \\\\in A$ that is larger than exactly $i-1$ other elements of $A$.\\nCan be solved in $O(n \\\\lg n)$ time by sorting.

The `MINIMUM` procedure iterates through elements, keeping track of smallest seen. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C9.1 MINIMUM(A, n)]]. This is optimal: in a tournament model, every element except the winner must lose at least one match.\\nTo find both minimum and maximum:\\n- Naive approach: $n-1$ for min, $n-1$ for max, total $2n-2$ comparisons.\\n- Better approach: Process elements in pairs. Compare pair elements ($A[k], A[k+1]$). Then compare smaller with current min, larger with current max. This is 3 comparisons for 2 elements. Total comparisons $\\\\approx 3n/2$. Specifically, at most $3 \\\\lfloor n/2 \\\\rfloor$ comparisons.\\n    - If $n$ is odd: Initialize min/max to $A[1]$. Process remaining $n-1$ elements in $(n-1)/2$ pairs. Total $3(n-1)/2 = 3\\\\lfloor n/2 \\\\rfloor$ comparisons.\\n    - If $n$ is even: Compare $A[1], A[2]$ to initialize min/max (1 comp). Process remaining $n-2$ elements in $(n-2)/2$ pairs.

Check pivot: If $i=k$, $A[q]$ is the answer.\\n5. Recurse: If $i < k$, recursively call `RANDOMIZED-SELECT` on $A[p \\\\ldots q-1]$ to find $i$-th smallest. If $i > k$, recursively call `RANDOMIZED-SELECT` on $A[q+1 \\\\ldots r]$ to find $(i-k)$-th smallest.

Expected running time $O(n)$ because pivot choice is random, leading to balanced partitions on average. If pivot lands in \\\"middle half\\\" (between 1st and 3rd quartiles), at least 1/4 of elements are eliminated. This happens with probability $\\\\approx 1/2$.\\n**Lemma 9.1**: A partitioning is helpful (reduces problem size by at least factor $3/4$) with probability at least $1/2$.\\n**Theorem 9.2**: The procedure `RANDOMIZED-SELECT` on an input array of $n$ distinct elements has an expected running time of $\\\\Theta(n)$.\\n*Proof sketch*: Define $A^{(j)}$ as elements in play after $j$ partitionings. A partitioning $h_k$ is helpful if $|A^{(h_k)}| \\\\le (3/4)|A^{(h_{k-1})}|$. Let $X_k$ be number of partitionings in generation $k$ (between $h_k$ and $h_{k+1}-1$). $E[X_k] \\\\le 2$. Total comparisons are bounded by $\\\\sum X_k |A^{(h_k)}|$. Expected total comparisons $\\\\sum E[X_k] |A^{(h_k)}| \\\\le \\\\sum 2 \\\\cdot (3/4)^k n_0 = O(n_0)$. Since initial scan by `PARTITION` is $\\\\Omega(n)$, total expected time is $\\\\Theta(n)$.\\n\\n## 9.3 Selection in worst-case linear time\\nThe `SELECT` algorithm finds the $i$-th smallest element in $O(n)$ worst-case time. It guarantees a good pivot choice. Refer to [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C9.3 SELECT(A, p, r, i)]].\\nAlgorithm steps for `SELECT(A, p, r, i)`:\\n1. Handle small $n$: If $n=(r-p+1)$ is not divisible by 5, the `while` loop (lines 1-8 in pseudocode, which is slightly different from book text for SELECT itself) effectively reduces $n$ by finding and removing the minimum element if $i>1$, or returning it if $i=1$, until $n \\bmod 5 = 0$. This takes $O(n)$ total for these initial steps.\\nCore steps for $n$ elements (assume $n \\bmod 5 = 0$ for this summary from book page 237, OCR page 82 lines 11-24):\\n   a. Divide $n$ elements into $g=n/5$ groups of 5 elements each.\\n   b. Find median of each 5-element group (e.g., by sorting each group, takes $O(1)$ per group, total $O(n)$ for all groups).\\n   c. Recursively call `SELECT` to find median $x$ of the $g$ group medians. This is the pivot.\\n   d. Partition array $A[p \\\\ldots r]$ around $x$ using a modified `PARTITION` (call it `PARTITION-AROUND`). Let $q$ be index of $x$.\\n   e. Let $k=q-p+1$ be rank of pivot $x$. If $i=k$, $x$ is the answer.\\n   f. If $i < k$, recursively call `SELECT` on $A[p \\\\ldots q-1]$ for $i$-th smallest.\\n   g. If $i > k$, recursively call `SELECT` on $A[q+1 \\\\ldots r]$ for $(i-k)$-th smallest.\\nFigure 9.3 of the book illustrates element relationships after partitioning around $x$.\\nAnalysis:\\n- Steps a, b, d take $O(n)$ time.\\n- Step c (recursive call for median of medians): $T(n/5)$ time since there are $n/5$ medians.\\n- Step e, f, or g (recursive call for selection): Pivot $x$ is median of $g=n/5$ medians. At least half the group medians are $\\\\le x$. For each such median, 2 more elements in its group are $\\\\le x$. So at least $3 \\\\cdot ( (n/5)/2 ) = 3n/10$ elements are $\\\\le x$. Similarly, at least $3n/10$ elements are $\\\\ge x$. This means that in the worst case, the recursive call in step f or g is on at most $n - 3n/10 = 7n/10$ elements.\\n- Recurrence relation: $T(n) \\\\le T(n/5) + T(7n/10) + O(n)$.\\n**Theorem 9.3**: The running time of `SELECT` on an input of $n$ elements is $\\\\Theta(n)$.\\n*Proof*: Using substitution method for $T(n) \\\\le cn$: $cn/5 + c(7n/10) + O(n) = c(9n/10) + O(n) = cn - cn/10 + O(n)$. This is $\\\\le cn$ if $c$ is large enough to dominate $O(n)$ term. Base cases ($n \\\\le 4$ for $n \\bmod 5$ loop, or small $n$ for main recursion) can be handled by choosing $c$ appropriately. Since some steps (like partitioning) take $\\\\Omega(n)$, overall time is $\\\\Theta(n)$.\\n\\n## Problems\\nChapter 9 problems include topics such as: Largest $i$ numbers in sorted order, Variant of randomized selection (see [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C9.P9-2 SIMPLER-RANDOMIZED-SELECT(A, p, r, i)]]), Weighted median, Small order statistics, Alternative analysis of randomized selection, Select with groups of 3 (uses [[PartII Sorting and Order Statistics Algorithms.md#C9.Notes SELECT3(A, p, r, i)]]).\\n\\n## Chapter notes\\nWorst-case linear-time median-finding algorithm by Blum, Floyd, Pratt, Rivest, and Tarjan (1973).

        "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to transform the provided OCR-ed book content from Part I into proper study notes. Let me start by going through the document step by step. \n\nFirst, the context mentions that the document is part of Part I: Foundations from \"Introduction to Algorithms.\" The structure in the OCR includes chapters 1 to 5, but the notes provided cover up to chapter 5. The study notes should be based on the structure from the provided files, integrating content from multiple files like 'foundations overview.md', 'PartI Foundations Algorithms.md', and others.\n\nStarting with Chapter 1, The Role of Algorithms. From the overview, an algorithm is a sequence of computational steps transforming input to output. A computational problem has a defined input/output relationship, and an algorithm's correctness is crucial. Data structures facilitate access and modifications. Hard problems include NP-complete issues like the traveling-salesperson problem. The study note needs to define these clearly, perhaps with bullet points for clarity.\n\nNext, Chapter 2: Getting Started. Insertion sort is an example of an incremental method. The loop invariant is described with initialization, maintenance, and termination. Analysis of algorithms in the RAM model. Divide-and-conquer with merge sort and recurrence relations. The summary should explain loop invariants as proof tools and the divide-conquer method, referencing the merge sort example.\n\nChapter 3 discusses asymptotic notation: \u0398 (tight bounds), O (upper), \u03a9 (lower), o, and \u03c9 for non-tight bounds. The analysis section should focus on these notations, emphasizing their role in order of growth and expected applications. \n\nChapters 4 and 5 have overviews on divide-and-conquer and probabilistic analysis/randomized algorithms. The notes should touch upon these as techniques for complex algorithm design and handling randomness in inputs or algorithm choices.\n\nLooking at the files, there's code for INSERTION-SORT, MERGE-SORT, and MERGE with time complexities. These should be integrated into algorithm analysis sections, explaining their time complexities and how they fit into the divide-and-conquer or incremental methods. \n\nI need to ensure that connections between concepts are clear. For example, how loop invariants prove the correctness of insertion sort, or how asymptotic notation helps in comparing algorithms like merge sort's \u0398(n lg n) versus insertion sort's \u0398(n\u00b2). \n\nRedundant information should be removed. For instance, if a concept is explained in multiple files, consolidate the explanation. Make sure technical terms are introduced correctly, like RAM model, computational problem instances, NP-complete problems.\n\nAvoid using bold formatting as per instructions. Use headings and subheadings for structure. Keep explanations in simple, clear language, maintaining technical details where necessary. For example, when explaining \u0398-notation, define it plainly but include the mathematical condition from the file. \n\nCheck for proper structure: each main topic is an H1, subtopics H2, etc. Use lists where appropriate, but prefer paragraphs over nested lists. \n\nPotential issues to watch for: making sure that all key algorithms (insertion sort, merge sort) are covered with their pseudocode and analysis, correct terminology in asymptotic notations, the role of data structures, and the distinction between different problem types including NP-complete.\n\nI need to synthesize the information from each file, ensuring that each concept from the OCR is rephrased and organized into concise study notes without losing essential information. Verify facts, especially when combining multiple sources. For example, merge sort's recurrence relation in the files should match the standard T(n)=2T(n/2)+\u0398(n) leading to \u0398(n lg n).\n\nAlso, consider the specified points like the role of algorithms in computing, problem instances, correctness, data structures, and the importance of choosing the right techniques like divide-and-conquer. Use examples like insertion sort for loop invariants, merge sort for divide-and-conquer, and the use of Big O, Theta, and Omega in runtime analysis.\n\nFinally, check that the structure follows the given headings and that all necessary details are included. Ensure that the notes are comprehensive yet concise, and that topics flow logically from basic algorithms to more complex analysis techniques.\n</think>\n\n# Algorithms: Foundations and Basic Techniques\n\n## The Role of Algorithms in Computing\n\nAn **algorithm** is a well-defined computational procedure that transforms input into output through a sequence of steps. It acts as a solution method for **computational problems**, which define the input-output relationship. For example:\n- **Sorting**: Input is a sequence of numbers; output is the sequence in ascending order.\n- **Graph problems**: Finding shortest paths or topological sorts.\n\nA **correct algorithm** halts with the correct output for every valid input instance. **Data structures** store and organize data, enabling efficient access and modification\u2014no single structure suits all scenarios.\n\nHard problems, like **NP-complete problems (e.g., traveling-salesman)**, lack known efficient solutions. Approximation algorithms are often used for such cases.\n\n---\n\n## Incremental Algorithms: Insertion Sort and Loop Invariants\n\n**Insertion sort** sorts an array incrementally by inserting each element into its correct position in the already sorted subarray. Example:\n```markdown\n1. For i = 2 to n  \n2.   key = A[i]  \n3.   Move A[i-1], A[i-2], ... to the right until A[j] \u2264 key is found  \n4.   Insert key at position j\n```\n**Loop invariant** proves correctness via three properties:\n1. **Initialization**: True before the first iteration.  \n2. **Maintenance**: True after each iteration.  \n3. **Termination**: Invariant gives the algorithm\u2019s correctness when the loop ends.  \n\nFor insertion sort:\n- Initialization: The first element is trivially sorted.  \n- Maintenance: Each iteration inserts the next element into the sorted subarray.  \n- Termination: The entire array is sorted after the loop ends.\n\n---\n\n## Analyzing Algorithms\n\n**Input size** ($n$) depends on the problem (e.g., number of elements for sorting, bit count for multiplication). **Running time** $T(n)$ is the number of operations in a **Random-Access Machine (RAM)** model, where basic operations take constant time.\n\n### Analysis Types\n- **Worst-case**: Longest runtime for any input of size $n$. Provides guarantees for real-time systems.  \n- **Average-case**: Expected runtime over all inputs of size $n$.  \n- **Order of growth**: Focuses on the leading term (e.g., $T(n) = an^2 + bn + c$ simplifies to $\u0398(n^2)$).\n\n**Merge sort** uses **divide-and-conquer**:\n1. **Divide**: Split the array into two halves.  \n2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort each half.  \n3. **Combine**: Merge the sorted halves in $\u0398(n)$ time.\n\nRecurrence for merge sort:\n$$  \nT(n) = \\begin{cases}  \n\u0398(1) & \\text{if } n = 1 \\\\  \n2T(n/2) + \u0398(n) & \\text{if } n > 1  \n\\end{cases}  \n\\quad \\text{solves to } T(n) = \u0398(n \\lg n).  \n$$\n\n---\n\n## Asymptotic Notation for Runtime Characterization\n\nUsed to describe the growth of functions (e.g., runtime) for large input sizes:\n\n| Notation | Definition | Example |  \n|----------|------------|---------|  \n| **$\u0398(g(n))** | Tight bound: $c_1g(n) \\leq f(n) \\leq c_2g(n)$ for constants | $7n^3 + 100n^2 = \u0398(n^3)$ |  \n| **$O(g(n))** | Upper bound: $f(n) \\leq cg(n)$ after $n \\geq n_0$ | $7n^3 + 100n^2 = O(n^3)$ and $O(n^4)$ |  \n| **$\u03a9(g(n))** | Lower bound: $f(n) \\geq cg(n)$ | $7n^3 + 100n^2 = \u03a9(n^3)$ |  \n| **$o(g(n))** | Non-tight upper bound: $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 0$ | $2n = o(n^2)$ |  \n| **$\u03c9(g(n))** | Non-tight lower bound: $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = \\infty$ | $\\frac{n^2}{2} = \u03c9(n)$ |  \n\n**Key properties**:\n- $\u0398$-notation: Tight bound (e.g., merge sort\u2019s $T(n) = \u0398(n \\lg n)$).  \n- $O$-notation ignores constant factors, focusing on scalability.\n\n---\n\n## Divide-and-Conquer Methods\n\nA recursive technique for algorithm design:\n1. **Divide** the problem into smaller subproblems.  \n2. **Conquer** by solving subproblems recursively.  \n3. **Combine** solutions to build the original problem\u2019s answer.  \n\n**Merge sort** exemplifies this:\n- **Divide**: Split at $q = \\lfloor(p+r)/2\\rfloor$.  \n- **Combine**: Merge two sorted subarrays in $\u0398(n)$ time.  \nRecurrence: $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \u0398(n)$ solves to $\u0398(n \\lg n)$ using recursion trees or the master method.\n\n---\n\n## Probabilistic Analysis and Randomization\n\n**Probabilistic analysis** assumes a known probability distribution over inputs (e.g., randomized versions of the hiring problem). **Randomized algorithms** use randomness (e.g., random permutation) to ensure performance guarantees for any input. Key concepts:\n- **Expected value**: Average runtime over random choices.  \n- **Indicator variables**: For event $A$, define $I\\{A\\} = 1$ if $A$ occurs, $0$ otherwise.  \n- **Applications**:  \n  - **Hiring problem**: Expected number of hires = $E[X] = H_n \\approx \\ln n + O(1)$ for $n$ candidates.  \n  - **Birthday paradox**: Expected $k=23$ people for a >50% chance of a shared birthday.  \n  - **Balls and bins**: Expected tosses to place one ball in each of $b$ bins = $b H_b \\approx b \\ln b$.  \n\n---\n\n## Connecting Concepts\n\n- **Algorithm efficiency**: Affects total runtime. Efficient algorithms (e.g., merge sort\u2019s $\u0398(n \\lg n)$) outperform slower ones (e.g., insertion sort\u2019s $\u0398(n^2)$) regardless of hardware.  \n- **Recursive divide-and-conquer**: Breaks problems into subproblems, solved recursively (e.g., Strassen\u2019s matrix multiplication in $\u0398(n^{\\lg 7})$).  \n- **Asymptotic analysis**: Focuses on growth rates. For large $n$, algorithms with lower-order growth (e.g., $\u0398(n \\lg n)$) are preferred over higher-order (e.g., $\u0398(n^2)$).  \n\nThis structure organizes the foundational concepts, ensuring clarity and logical flow."

These structures\u2014arrays, matrices, stacks, queues, linked lists, and tree representations\u2014form the building blocks for more advanced algorithms. Each structure balances simplicity against performance trade-offs depending on the operations required.  \n\n## Arrays and Their Extensions  \n\nAn **array** is a contiguous block of memory where elements are accessed via indices. In most programming contexts, arrays have 1-origin indexing, but implementations may use 0-origin or other schemes. The RAM model assumes array access takes constant time, though practical arrays may hold pointers to heterogeneous-sized elements, maintaining constant-time access through indirection. Indexing formulas for multi-dimensional arrays depend on storage order: row-major (used in C-like languages) or column-major (used in Fortran) for matrices. For an $m \\times n$ matrix stored row-wise, element $M[i,j]$ maps to index $ni + j$. Sparse matrices, where most elements are zero, often use compressed storage schemes to save space and optimize operations.  \n\n## Matrices: Storage vs. Computation  \n\nMatrices, a specialization of 2D arrays, require efficient handling for computational tasks. Two primary storage strategies are **row-major** (rows stored sequentially) and **column-major** (columns stored sequentially). For an $m \\times n$ matrix $M$, element $M[i,j]$ in row-major order corresponds to linear index $ni + j$ (0-origin) or $1 + i(m-1) + j$ (1-origin), while column-major uses $j m + i$. When $n$ is divisible by the cache line size, row-major access excels in space locality during row-wise computations. Conversely, algorithms iterating column-wise may prefer column-major order to optimize cache usage. Block decompositions\u2014partitioning a matrix into contiguous submatrices\u2014assist in parallel computation and out-of-core processing.  \n\n## Stacks and Queues: Controlling Access Patterns  \n\n**Stacks** and **queues** are restricted-access dynamic sets with fixed element-removal policies. A **stack** follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) discipline, where `PUSH` adds elements and `POP` removes the most recently added. A **queue** adheres to a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) rule, with `ENQUEUE` adding elements to one end and `DEQUEUE` removing them from the other. Implementations often rely on arrays, with stacks tracking a `top` pointer and queues managing `head` and `tail` indices. Errors arise during underflow (removing from an empty structure) and overflow (no space). Stacks underpin depth-first search and function call management, while queues order breadth-first traversal and task scheduling.  \n\n## Linked Lists: Dynamic Memory in Series  \n\nA **linked list** stores elements in nodes connected by pointers, each node containing a `key`, a `next` pointer, and, in doubly linked lists, a `prev` pointer. Unlike arrays, linked lists excel in constant-time insertions and deletions when the correct node is identified. Searching, however, degrades to $O(n)$ time unless augmented with auxiliary data like hash tables. **Singly linked lists** only track `next`, simplifying memory but complicating bidirectional traversal. **Doubly linked lists** facilitate efficient $O(1)$ deletions if given a direct reference to the node, as both neighbors adjust pointers. Sentinel nodes (head/tail placeholders) eliminate conditional branches in edge cases during updates. For instance, a circular linked list connects the last node\u2019s `next` to the first and the first\u2019s `prev` to the last, simplifying rotations.  \n\n### Sentinel Nodes: Simplifying Boundary Conditions  \n\nSentinel nodes, such as $L.nil$ in doubly linked lists, act as fictitious elements that streamline edge logic. By ensuring the list never becomes truly empty (every operation addresses at least one sentinel), algorithms avoid special handling for empty or singleton lists. For example, a search operation like `LIST-SEARCH'` stores the target key in the sentinel, ensuring the loop always terminates when the sentinel is encountered, even if the key isn\u2019t present. Similarly, `LIST-DELETE'` updates only four pointers without conditional checks. While sentinels use extra space, they reduce branching logic complexity, which can yield performance gains in tight loops.  \n\n## Implementing Dynamic Sets: Practical Trade-offs  \n\nEach structure has strengths:  \n- **Unsorted arrays** offer $O(1)$ insertions (append to end) and $O(1)$ access by index but $O(n)$ for `SEARCH`.  \n- **Sorted arrays** perform binary search in $O(\\log n)$ but require $O(n)$ time for insertions and deletions.  \n- **Linked lists** enable $O(1)$ insertions/deletions via direct references but $O(n)$ searches. Sorted linked lists improve minimum/maximum access to $O(1)$ but require sorted insertions ($O(n)$).  \n- **Hash tables** (Chapter 11) provide average-case $O(1)$ operations but are omitted here.  \n\nDynamic sets track metadata like `head`, `tail`, or `size` to maintain integrity. For hybrid structures like a **heap-ordered array**, the heap property takes precedence over simple dynamic operations.  \n\n## Trees: Hierarchically Structuring Data  \n\nTrees extend linear lists by allowing $O(1)$-child references per node, with each node in a **binary tree** having `left` and `right` children. Binary search trees (Chapter 12) constrain the left subtree to values \u2264 the node and the right subtree to values > the node, enabling $O(h)$-time operations. Trees generalize to multiway branches through the **left-child, right-sibling representation**, where a node tracks its leftmost child and next sibling. This representation collapses k-ary trees into binary trees without losing navigability. For example, the left-child of node $x$ becomes $x$\u2019s first child, and the right-sibling becomes its next sibling. This representation uses $O(n)$ space for $n$-node trees, with traversal operations mirroring standard tree algorithms. However, random access to arbitrary children remains nontrivial.  \n\nRed-black trees (Chapter 13) and balanced trees attempt to control $h$, but even unbalanced binary search trees require $O(n)$ time for worst-case operations. The trade-off between structure complexity (e.g., rotations in balanced trees) and average-case guarantees determines practical utility.  \n\n## Comparative Summary  \n\nLinear structures (arrays, linked lists) and hierarchical ones (trees) serve distinct roles. Arrays benefit from cache locality and predictable memory layouts, while linked lists accommodate dynamic expansions without reallocation. Hash tables often provide the best average-case efficiency for basic set operations, but their construction incurs overhead. For applications demanding strict time bounds, balanced trees like red-black trees guarantee $O(\\log n)$ heights. When implementing data structures, understanding access patterns, memory efficiency, and algorithmic constraints is critical to optimizing performance and correctness."

They are characterized by the use of indices or subscripts, allowing for direct access to each element in constant time, O(1), provided the index is known. The most elementary use of arrays is for the storage and manipulation of sequences of data such as characters in a string form, grades of students, or any indexed data structure requiring O(1) access. When the computational model includes hardware-level properties, such as caching lines on cache-enabled processors, arrays offer the advantage of memory locality and faster retrieval in comparison to other data structures. The performance benefits of arrays stem from their ability to provide contiguous memory allocation, allowing for better predictive fetching by the CPU. However, the fundamental limitation of arrays is their static size, making them inefficient for dynamic sets requiring frequent resizing.\n\nArrays can be extended into multi-dimensional structures, notably matrices, which are two-dimensional data structures used in numerical computations and linear algebra. Matrices expand the use of arrays for simultaneous equations, transformations, and algorithms that make up computer graphics and optimization. Implementation of matrices in languages like Fortran and C follows different storage strategies: column-major (column-wise layout of matrices in Fortran) and row-major order (row-wise layout of matrices in C-style languages). The row-major order stores consecutive elements of a matrix row in contiguous memory locations, while column-major order does the same for matrix columns. Programmers and compilers must be cognizant of these storage orders to leverage cache coherence for matrix operations. Both storage strategies have performance implications, mostly influenced by the pattern of data access, with a focus on minimizing cache misses.\n\nWhen considering data structure complexity as it relates to arrays and matrices, array indices may be derived from a formula involving the address of the array, the index, and the size of each element, which may be crucial for memory management and efficient processing.\n\n### Matrices: Storage vs. Computation\n\nMatrices, typically implemented in memory as arrays, are primarily indexed by two subscripts for rows and columns. Accessing an element in a matrix may take a form such as $ M[i][j] $, but the address of these elements is calculated by the formula depending upon the language. In row-major order, for an element $ M[i][j] $ in a matrix with $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns, the linear memory layout calculation is $ i \\times m + j $. In column-major order, which is Fortran's default, the formula changes to $ i + j \\times n $. These formulas become critical when performing memory accesses efficiently or when mapping multidimensional arrays to a linear memory space in systems like linear time-invariant filter implementations for digital signal processing or when handling tensors in neural network computations.\n\nThe contiguous layout of matrices becomes essential in applications dealing with large datasets, such as in image processing or scientific simulations, which require efficient iteration. The choice between row-major vs. column-major ordering is crucial here, influencing cache coherency and thus computational efficiency. For algorithms that iteratively process rows, row-major storage minimizes cache misses and maximizes performance. Conversely, column-wise operations are optimized with column-major data placement. Matrix partitioning, a technique where a large matrix is decomposed into submatrices, exemplifies another optimization where computation on smaller blocks is executed sequentially to manage memory constraints and optimize for available cache sizes.\n\nMatrices go beyond two dimensions to serve as three-dimensional and higher structures (tensors) where the nested indices are handled similarly to multi-dimensional arrays, which has become increasingly relevant in complex data analysis and machine learning fields. Matrix transposition and multiplication are at the core of many numerical algorithms, with implementations needing to take into account computational complexity (that is, the number of arithmetic operations) as well as data copying between memory areas in and out of processors.\n\n### Stacks and Queues: Controlling Access Patterns\n\n**Stacks**, a specialized form of the array or dynamic data structure, represent the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) approach. The stack operations, Push and Pop, alter the structure by adding elements on top or removing them from the top respectively, using a top index to track the current position. All operations are relatively straightforward and highly optimized. Stacks are essential in the implementation of function calls in programming languages and execution of backtracking algorithms. Stack overflows occur when all available memory is consumed, while underflows occur when attempting to pop from an empty stack. Real-world applications where stacks are utilized include syntax parsing, expression evaluation, and recursion implementation.  \n\n**Queues**, another specialized form of array, follow the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element that enters the queue is the first one to get processed. Operations on queues include Enqueue and Dequeue, which add elements to the end and remove elements from the front of the queue. A queue is generally implemented using a circular array where the head and tail of the queue can 'wrap around' as the indices reach the end of the array, forming a ring where the queue can use the entire pre-allocated memory before it overflows. Overflow occurs when the queue is full, while underflow happens when an empty queue is dequeued.\n\nThe trade-off for queues using arrays is the static memory allocation upfront, whereas linked lists allow a queue to grow and shrink as needed. Queues are instrumental in process scheduling in operating systems and in the design of real-time services where elements must be processed in the order of arrival as a first-come-first-served algorithm, such as a ticket counter operation.\n\n### Linked Lists: Dynamic Memory in Series\n\nIn contrast to static arrays, which allow constant-time access by index but are challenging to modify, **linked lists** excel in dynamic data manipulation. A singly linked list, where each node points to the next, represents a linear data structure that can grow and shrink in size as needed, with the time complexity of searching remaining O(n) but insertion and deletion operations reducible to O(1) if the node preceding the operation's position is known.\n\nA **doubly-linked list**, which allows traversal in both forward and reverse directions, adds another pointer for each node that references the previous node. This provides more flexibility in data manipulation and manipulation in a complex scenario where bidirectional navigation and operation are significant (e.g., browser history, undo-redo functionality in software development). Each additional pointer increases memory usage but simplifies deletion operations and enables reversing the order of elements efficiently.\n\nIn operations requiring the insertion of a node at the end, linked lists may keep a tail pointer. For certain implementations, especially when dealing with trees and graph representations, a linked list also allows each node to have an arbitrary number of links to other nodes (adjacency list), a highly effective practice in graph algorithms. The use of a sentinel or dummy node simplifies edge case management, particularly for nodes at the beginning and end of the list. This design ensures that all operations such as insertion and deletion can be handled in a uniform way without special-case handling. Implementations of stacks and queues can also take advantage of linked lists, allowing for dynamic size as dictated by the application\u2019s requirements.\n\n### Trees and Representations in Memory\n\nIn computer science, **trees are hierarchical structures** comprising nodes connected by edges that define parent-child relationships. The topmost node is the root, and each node can have zero or more child nodes, forming a recursive structure that is fundamental for operations that follow a divide-and-conquer approach, such as file system navigation or XML parsing. Binary trees allow for each node to have at most two child nodes typically referred to as the left child and right child, enabling efficient traversal and search operations. Binary search trees refine this structure by enforcing an ordering constraint\u2014an in-order traversal yields elements in sorted order.\n\nMemory representations of trees are varied, but for a binary tree node, it may consist of a data field, and two pointers to its left and right children, with each field representing a node's value and pointers the potential offspring, facilitating operations such as insertion at a certain location or deletion of a specified value with minimal structural modification. The left-child, right-sibling representation is an advanced method of memory representation for general trees, where each node contains a pointer to its leftmost child and a pointer to its right sibling. This representation allows a general tree to be restructured as a binary tree, with each node having only two pointers that can be managed more easily, simplifying certain operations like tree traversal and updates.\n\nFor multiway trees, each non-terminal node typically has a fixed number of branches, which complicates implementation due to variable numbers of children for nodes. In this context, each node may contain an array of pointers to children, and if the branching factor is large, more sophisticated data structures like B-Tree, a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for search, insert, and delete operations in logarithmic time, become more efficient. Binary trees, particularly binary search trees and balanced trees like AVL and Red-Black Trees, ensure that search, insert, and delete operations remain efficient. Specialized binary tree forms, like heaps for efficiently providing maximum or minimum value, are represented as arrays with implicit structural properties, lending themselves to algorithmic operations as found in the heap sort or priority queues implementations.\n\nTrees represent a dynamic set structure that supports efficient searching and updates given the right balancing strategy, and the design of these structures is often a trade-off between the complexity of implementation and the efficiency of operations. For a node pointer-based tree representation, tree manipulation often involves traversal, rotation, or restructuring algorithms to maintain desired properties such as balance.\n\n### Sentinel Nodes and Their Advantages\n\n**Sentinel nodes**, or dummy nodes, provide a neat simplification for handling edge cases in linked list and other pointer-based data structure implementation. In a singly linked list, for example, a sentinel node can represent a dummy head or tail. This eliminates the need to handle the special case for the actual head or tail, as operations can uniformly treat all nodes, including both data nodes and sentinel nodes, simplifying insertion and deletion logic. Advanced structures such as circular linked lists may have a sentinel at the head, from which iteration can begin and end, again reducing the number of special cases to manage.\n\nBy integrating sentinel nodes into algorithms that manage dynamic datasets, various benefits are realized. When searching for elements, a sentinel node may act as a probe, ensuring the loop exits once the sentinel is reached, thus improving the performance by reducing the probability of conditional checks within loops. In dynamic structures, sentinels obviate the need for null pointer checks, as a sentinel assures at least one node is always present, thus reducing the overhead involved in boundary conditions, particularly for insert and delete operations where either pointer handling becomes more uniform around the list.\n\nEffective usage of sentinel nodes in dynamic data structures provides a conceptual shift in dealing with edge cases and can lead to performance gains in applications ranging from database indexes to operating systems processes managing dynamic memory allocations.\n\n### Trees as a Hierarchical Data Storage Mechanism\n\nIn terms of data organization and management, **trees serve as a mechanism for defining and managing hierarchical relationships** between data elements. Trees are more versatile than linear data structures like arrays and linked lists, given that they can represent a hierarchy that is not easy to model with the latter. The central idea of a tree is its recursive nature, where a tree can consist of a root and a possibly empty set of subtrees, each of which is a tree. Trees for data representation can naturally capture scenarios where the data or relationships between entities of interest form a hierarchical structure, such as an organization chart, an XML document, or a filesystem tree.\n\nTree operations typically include traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), insertion, deletion, and certain node searches. The traversal methods form the basis for many tree operations including sorting, data structure manipulation, and specific aggregate functions like finding the maximum or minimum value. The binary search tree variant adds rigor to the node property, enforcing an ordering that allows for fast searching and updating operations where each node has at most two children, with all keys in the left subtree keys being less than the root, and all right subtree keys being more than the root. Despite their efficiency, unbalanced binary search trees can exhibit the performance of linked lists, hence the need for self-balancing strategies found in AVL trees and their kin.\n\nAdvanced representations and manipulations of trees play a critical role in computer graphics (scene graphs in rendering), computational geometry (quad-trees or binary space partitioning for collision detection), and databases (B-trees for indexing), allowing operations to be executed in a time-efficient manner relative to data sizes. With trees, time complexity for operations can often be reduced from linear to logarithmic scale, offering performance improvements across multiple problem domains including file systems, search and indexing processes, and network routing.\n\n</think>\n\n"

        "content": "<think>\nAlright, let's adjust to provide more detailed long-form content for Chapter 10 according to the prior instructions.\n\n### Arrays and Their Extensions\n\nArrays in programming are fundamental data structures for organizing and accessing a collection of elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. They are characterized by the use of indices or subscripts, allowing for direct access to each element in constant time, O(1), provided the index is known. The most elementary use of arrays is for the storage and manipulation of sequences of data such as characters in a string form, grades of students, or any indexed data structure requiring O(1) access. When the computational model includes hardware-level properties, such as caching lines on cache-enabled processors, arrays offer the advantage of memory locality and faster retrieval in comparison to other data structures. The performance benefits of arrays stem from their ability to provide contiguous memory allocation, allowing for better predictive fetching by the CPU. However, the fundamental limitation of arrays is their static size, making them inefficient for dynamic sets requiring frequent resizing.\n\nArrays can be extended into multi-dimensional structures, notably matrices, which are two-dimensional data structures used in numerical computations and linear algebra. Matrices expand the use of arrays for simultaneous equations, transformations, and algorithms that make up computer graphics and optimization. Implementation of matrices in languages like Fortran and C follows different storage strategies: column-major (column-wise layout of matrices in Fortran) and row-major order (row-wise layout of matrices in C-style languages). The row-major order stores consecutive elements of a matrix row in contiguous memory locations, while column-major order does the same for matrix columns. Programmers and compilers must be cognizant of these storage orders to leverage cache coherence for matrix operations.

With trees, time complexity for operations can often be reduced from linear to logarithmic scale, offering performance improvements across multiple problem domains including file systems, search and indexing processes, and network routing.\n</think>\n\n# Chapter 10: Structures of Dynamic Sets\n\nIn computer science, the design and implementation of data structures are fundamental in establishing the efficiency and complexity of algorithms. Chapter 10 of the referenced material deals with elementary data structures that implement **dynamic sets**, a basic yet essential data model for algorithm development. A dynamic set supports operations that allow the expansion, contraction, or internal modifications of its elements. This chapter is crucial as it underlies many higher-level constructs and directly affects algorithmic efficiency with regard to time and space complexity.\n\n## Arrays and Matrices\n\nAn array is one of the most foundational data structures, representing a collection of elements of a uniform type that can be directly accessed by numeric index. Arrays are implemented as a contiguous block of memory, enabling efficient indexing because the position of each element can be calculated as an offset from the base address of the array. For operations on large datasets, arrays provide the advantage of spatial locality which can optimize performance on memory-hierarchical systems.\n\nMatrices, on the other hand, can be seen as a direct extension of arrays. They are typically structured as two-dimensional arrays used in operations involving linear algebra. When matrices become large, operations such as matrix multiplication or inversion can dominate computational resources and time\u2014an issue often mitigated by specialized storage and algorithms that exploit matrix structure, such as sparsity or symmetry.\n\n- **Row-Major and Column-Major Ordering**: The storage layout of matrices is a crucial consideration for optimal performance. In row-major order, consecutive elements of a row are stored contiguously, whereas in column-major order, the elements of a column of the matrix are contiguous in memory. One must choose an ordering that aligns with the access pattern during processing to maximize cache efficiency. For instance, row-major is typically employed when accessing the matrix row by row for tasks like successive applications of row operations.\n\n- **Efficiency and Matrix Blocks**: Certain matrix operations can be optimized by partitioning the matrix into blocks. For algorithms such as LU decomposition, and in library calls within computational mathematics, this approach can help manage matrices that are too large to fit fully in fast memory by processing them as smaller, cache-aware submatrices.\n\n- **Matrix Applications**: Matrices are the cornerstone of scientific computing and are used to represent systems of linear equations, transformations in computer graphics, and relationships in graphs. The computational demands of matrix operations require significant attention to optimization techniques.\n\n## Stacks and Queues\n\n**Stacks** and **queues** are abstract data types that offer specific, restricted operations on sets of elements. They are pivotal for managing operations where the order of processing is essential\u2014such as in undo-redo functionality or task scheduling.\n\n- **Stacks** enforce the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) access pattern, which is suitable for recursive processes or storing suspended tasks. They are often deployed in parsing expressions in compilers or processors to handle nested function calls. The push and pop operations for stacks are both constant time functions as they only modify the top element. Stack underflow occurs if a pop is executed on an empty stack, while overflow is caused when the stack is full, an issue that can often be resolved through dynamic resizing.\n\n- **Queues**, in contrast, follow a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) protocol, where the oldest element in the set is processed next. This order is crucial in real-world applications such as printers managing print queues or telecommunications systems for call center call handling. Queues are typically implemented with circular arrays or linked lists and support operations such as enqueue to add an element and dequeue to remove one.\n\n## Linked Lists\n\n**Linked lists** are linear data structures where each element contains a value and reference (or \"link\") to the next element. They provide a flexible way to handle sets where size varies over time and random element access is not the norm.\n\n- **Singly and Doubly-Linked Lists**: Singly-linked lists allow traversal only in one direction\u2014all operations start at the head and move through the list using the 'next' pointer found in each element. Doubly-linked lists enable traversal in both directions due to an additional 'prev' pointer, which allows element removal without traversing from the head.\n\n- **Flexible Operations**: The links between nodes in a singly-linked list enable dynamic memory allocation, allowing efficient insertion and deletion operations. However, without an index, searching for a given element is an O(n) operation, which is slower than arrays. Sentinels are optional in linked list representations but can simplify edge-case logic, especially around the head and tail of the list.\n\n- **Sentinel Nodes**: A sentinel is a fixed dummy node. In a linked list with a single sentinel, all real nodes are placed between the sentinel and the list ends, simplifying implementation by removing the need for special case handling around the head and tail.\n\n## Trees\n\nThe **tree** is a hierarchical data structure in which each node possesses a parent node (except the root node) and zero or more child nodes, forming a recursive structure. Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships\u2014such as the directory structure in a file system or as a method for organizing data to achieve efficient searching and sorting.\n\n- **Binary Trees and Search Optimization**: Binary trees extend the concept such that each node has at most two children referred to as the left and right child. This structure lies at the core of quick and efficient searching and sorting algorithms. Specifically, when the values in a binary tree maintain order among the nodes, namely in a Binary Search Tree (BST), it leads to average search times of $O(\\log n)$. This efficiency is the basis for advanced data structures like balanced trees (red-black trees, AVL trees) which guarantee $O(\\log n)$ operations.\n\n- **Dynamic Tree Structures**: Trees can be represented without pointers using various methods tailored for efficient memory usage, such as the left-child, right-sibling representation. This particular approach allows a binary tree to represent trees with arbitrary numbers of children per node. Tree rotations are a specialized operation in self-balancing trees to maintain the height of the tree as balanced as possible.\n\n## Implementing Dynamic Sets: Practical Trade-offs\n\nIn terms of practical algorithm design and performance, each of the data structures has strengths in various scenarios:\n\n- **Unsorted Arrays and Lists** provide fast insertions (at the end for arrays) and constant-time access by index but exhibit linear behavior for search operations. These are suitable when random access is not needed, and inserts are at the end of the dataset.\n\n- **Sorted Arrays and Lists** offer improved access times for certain operations like binary search, yielding $O(\\log n)$ time for retrieval, insertions, and deletions, which is significantly faster than linear scanning.\n\n- **Hash Tables**, implied in advanced use cases but not directly detailed in this chapter, can offer constant average-case time for basic operations. However, this efficiency is a function of a good hashing function and careful collision management strategy.\n\nDynamic sets are often expected to maintain a size, and structures can be efficient under insertions, deletions, and searches as follows:\n\n- For arrays and matrices, constant-time access by index is accompanied by linear time for searches.\n- Stacks and queues limit element manipulation to their restricted access, though optimizing performance in specific use cases.\n- Searching within linked lists takes linear time, but operations like insertion and deletion (when the node location is known) perform in constant time.\n- Tree-based structures support more efficient operations, particularly when balanced to keep the tree\u2019s height minimal.\n\nIn essence, the choice of data structure for a dynamic set critically affects real-world performance as it directly impacts the algorithm's asymptotic complexity. Balancing these trade-offs with respect to specific operations in an algorithm (e.g., speed of insertion vs. speed of search) mandates a profound understanding of these elementary data structures and their performance characteristics. They are the foundational tools that data-driven algorithms leverage to optimize for the computational cost of basic set manipulations in dynamic environments. Achieving the right balance between time and space considerations shapes the behavior of algorithms in practice, and this knowledge is a core part of both theoretical and practical algorithm design."

They want paragraphs with thorough explanations, proper technical depth, and the algorithms integrated into the text, not just listed as bullet points.\n\nLet me structure this by starting with an introduction to data structures as the foundation. Then discuss arrays and matrices thoroughly, touching on memory layouts. Transition into stacks and queues with pseudocode and operation explanations. Cover linked lists, their variants, and the use of sentinel nodes. Then move into tree representations and the importance of binary structures. Finally, incorporate the algorithms directly into the discussion, explaining how they function as part of these data structures. \n\nI have to ensure that each section flows into the next with seamless paragraphs. Algorithms like INSERTION-SORT or operations such as PUSH and POP in stacks should be spelled out with their pseudocode and explained in the narrative. Avoid bullet points that segment the content. Also, make sure that pseudocode examples like those from Part III Data Structures Algorithms are integrated naturally into the discussion, explaining their steps and how they affect the respective data structures.\n\nI need to closely follow the material from the document, addressing elementary data structures as per Chapter 10. Details must be drawn from the given files, with extensive coverage of arrays, matrices, stacks, queues, linked lists, sentinel nodes, and tree representations. Algorithms like LIST-SEARCH or procedures for implementing a QUEUE should be included in the content, with their functionalities described within the flow of the narrative.\n\nThe goal is to provide an extensive, well-documented chapter content without using bullet points, with algorithms clearly presented in the context of the structures they pertain to. I'll ensure each data structure is discussed in depth and with the corresponding algorithmic operations as per the reference materials.\n</think>\n\nChapter 10 of *\"Introduction to Algorithms\"* is devoted to elementary data structures that realize **dynamic sets**\u2014collections of elements undergoing insertion, deletion, and query operations such that every change to the collection must respect specific access constraints. These structures form the foundational elements of algorithm design, dictating how efficiently algorithms can run and how resource-intensive those operations will be. In this chapter, we explore the internal mechanics, trade-offs between access patterns and modification, and practical algorithms for stacks, queues, linked lists, and tree representations\u2014all viewed through the lens of their implementation and analysis within algorithmic contexts.\n\n---\n\n### Arrays and Matrices: Indexing and Layout\n\nAn **array** is arguably the most primitive data structure within algorithmic design, yet its simplicity delivers robust efficiency gains in indexing and storage. Arrays are stored in contiguous memory, and access to an element $A[i]$ in a 1-based array can be calculated as memory at address $base + (i - 1) \\times size\\_of(element)$. This linearity in addressing is the reason why arrays support $O(1)$-access operations.\n\n**Matrices** generalize arrays into two or more dimensions, and their representation significantly affects performance in numerical solvers and graph traversal algorithms. A common pitfall in algorithm design is neglecting the matrix layout in memory. **Row-major order**, where rows are stored contiguously, is foundational to the C programming language\u2019s array handling, and optimizes cache use in matrix multiplication involving row-wise traversals. Conversely, **column-major order**\u2014used in FORTRAN\u2014is advantageous in systems where columnar data is frequently accessed, such as in solving systems of equations with Gaussian elimination. The selection of a matrix layout must be made in conjunction with expected memory accesses, as this decision heavily influences runtime due to processor caching behavior.\n\nPseudocode for a matrix transpose in row-major order exhibits an $O(n^2)$ complexity due to nested loops:\n\n```plaintext\nTRANSPOSE(M, n)\n1  for i = 1 to n\n2     for j = i+1 to n\n3         swap M[i][j] and M[j][i]\n```\n\nThough each individual operation is a constant-time swap, the necessity of iterating through the upper triangle demonstrates the quadratic complexity that arises when altering the structure of a matrix dependent on its size.\n\n---\n\n### Stacks and Queues: Organizing Data by Access Order\n\n**Stacks** and **queues** exemplify abstract data types that constrain element order through a defined discipline:\n- **Stacks** follow a **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** model that finds utility in function call stacks, parser building for context-free language recognition, and backtracking algorithms.\n- **Queues** adhere to a **First In, First Out (FIFO)** discipline, essential in bread-first traversal algorithms and process scheduling in operating systems.\n\nAn array-based **stack** maintains an attribute $top$, which dynamically adjusts as elements are placed on (pushed to) or removed from (popped from) the top of the stack. Stack overflow occurs when an attempted push exceeds the capacity of the space; underflow results when a pop is executed on an empty stack. These constraints are managed via error handling within algorithmic design:\n\n```plaintext\nPUSH(S, x)\n1  if S.top == S.size\n2      error \"overflow\"\n3  else\n4      S.top = S.top + 1\n5      S[S.top] = x\n```\n\nFor a stack implemented as a bounded array, the necessity for error checking underlines the importance of careful space allocation. In contrast, a **queue**, with attributes $head$ and $tail$, reflects a production line model where consumers (head) lag producers ($tail$):\n\n```plaintext\nENQUEUE(Q, x)\n1  Q[Q.tail] = x\n2  if Q.tail == Q.length\n3      Q.tail = 1\n4  else\n5      Q.tail = Q.tail + 1\n```\n\nUnlike stacks, queues require more involved logic to support circularly managed arrays, making each queue operation have a constant upper bound on complexity but introducing the possibility of head-tail collision that must be vigilantly avoided.\n\n---\n\n### Linked Lists: Dynamic and Flexible Structures\n\n**Linked lists** differ from arrays by maintaining a **dynamic**, sequence of nodes rather than a fixed-memory allocation. Each node comprises:\n- A data element (key), and \n- A pointer to the next node in the sequence.\n\nThis design yields $O(1)$ insertions and deletions when given a reference to the specific node. However, random access to nodes degrades to $O(n)$ due to the need to traverse from the head of the list. An essential trade-off in linked lists arises in choosing between **singly** and **doubly** linked implementations:\n- **Singly linked lists** (each node leads only to the next) favor simplicity, conserving memory, and are appropriate for forward-only use cases such as sequential file processing.\n- **Doubly linked lists** (each node leads to both a next and previous node) allow traversal in both directions at the cost of additional pointer management, essential for undo/redo functionality in applications.\n\nWhen implementing these in algorithms, memory management is critical. Consider the efficient `LIST-INSERT`:\n\n```plaintext\nLIST-INSERT(L, x)\n1  if L.head == NIL\n2      L.head = x\n3  else\n4      x.next = L.head\n5      L.head = x\n```\n\nThis pseudocode inserts node $x$ at the head of list $L$ in $O(1)$ time. A key strength of linked lists is their scalability in iterative structures such as **sparse graphs** or **polymorphic collection interfaces**.\n\nSentinel nodes, such as $L.nil$ in doubly linked lists, can simplify edge cases. Sentinels effectively act as guard regions in the data structure, such that instead of dealing with `NULL` and its implications on conditional logic, the sentinel, $L.nil$, acts as an intermediary node ensuring that all nodes adhere to a typical structure. The `LIST-SEARCH` operation using a sentinel becomes:\n\n```plaintext\nLIST-SEARCH'(L, k)\n1  L.nil.key = k         // Sentinel ensures we will find k\n2  x = L.nil.next\n3  while x.key != k\n4      x = x.next\n5  if x == L.nil\n6      return NIL\n7  else\n8      return x\n```\n\nThis search is optimized by guaranteeing the loop will always return due to the sentinel placing a sentinel key at its location prior to iteration.\n\n---\n\n### Tree Structures: Organizing Data Hierarchically\n\nTree structures introduce a hierarchical decomposition of problem spaces and are vital in algorithm applications ranging from divide-and-conquer to advanced search techniques. Binary trees serve as a building block for further structures like **heaps**, which underpin the heapsort algorithm and priority queue data structures described in earlier chapters. Each node in a binary tree has, at most, two children\u2014left and right\u2014and algorithms that operate on trees frequently recurse down their branches using self-similar code structures like:\n\n```plaintext\nINORDER-TREE-WALK(x)\n1  if x != NIL\n2      INORDER-TREE-WALK(x.left)\n3      print x.key\n4      INORDER-TREE-WALK(x.right)\n```\n\nThis recursive traversal, as seen in binary search trees, outputs the elements' keys in sorted order based on their hierarchical position.\n\nThe memory layout of a general tree can be challenging. The **left-child, right-sibling representation** eschews maintaining an arbitrary number of children per node in favor of a binary tree-like approach where each node has a pointer to its leftmost child and right sibling:\n\n- $x.left-child:$ points to the first child.\n- $x.right-sibling:$ points to the next sibling in sequence.\n\nThis structure simplifies the tree traversal code and conserves memory since each node, regardless of its parent\u2019s complexity, adheres to two pointer management constraints.\n\nManaging trees efficiently is also essential for **balanced search trees** presented in more advanced algorithms, such as red-black trees from Chapter 13, where operations maintain structural requirements maintaining logarithmic time complexity for insertion, deletion, and query operations.\n\n---\n\n### Implementing Dynamic Sets and Complex Structures\n\nWhen implementing dynamic sets through data structures, the type of data and frequency of expected operations determine which structure to choose:\n- **Unsorted arrays** excel in insertion and deletion where order is irrelevant, while **sorted arrays** provide efficient search capabilities at the cost of insertion and deletion latency.\n- For scenarios where the set has frequent queries for closest neighbors, **balanced tree structures**\u2014like the red-black trees introduced later\u2014are essential for preserving performance guarantees.\n\nEfficient algorithms often demand a hybrid approach. For example, **caches in file systems** leverage arrays for directory hierarchy traversal while handling individual file access through **trees** for sorted searching. Similarly, **B-trees**, which allow for efficient disk I/O operations by consolidating multiple keys per node, represent an evolution of tree-based structures for handling data at scale.\n\nThe role of these structures in algorithms is significant; for example:\n- An unsorted dynamic set implemented with an array would permit constant time *insertions* but induce linear time *searches*, while a **hash table** allows for average-case constant time insertions, deletions, and searches under **random hashing functions**\u2014a subject reserved for later sections.\n\n---\n\nBy delving into the algorithmic properties of these simple but omnipresent data structures, understanding how to engineer scalable, agile, and robust systems is possible. Every high-level implementation stands on the firm foundation of arrays operating at a base level and linked lists offering flexible expansion. Each structure\u2014be it a stack for managing recursion, queues for managing round-robin priorities, or trees for dynamic substructure representation\u2014has an algorithm built around them. As the discussion progresses into hash tables, binary search trees, and beyond, these elementary structures will illustrate the recurring themes in algorithm design: efficiency in memory usage, balancing complexity against performance, and managing data through constrained and hierarchical access for optimized computational pathways."

The chapter emphasizes not just the theoretical underpinnings of stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees but also provides algorithmic details critical for performance tuning in a multitude of contexts within algorithm design.\n\n---\n\n### Arrays and Matrices: Building Blocks for Computational Methods\n\nThe most basic and ubiquitous structure for storing data within any computational algorithm is the array\u2014a linear, indexed, and contiguous block of memory that allows access operations in constant time. Arrays act as the fundamental mechanism for higher-level data constructs such as matrices and vectors, which are crucial in fields like numerical linear algebra, in which large datasets are manipulated with operations like inversion, multiplication, and transposition.\n\nMatrices, particularly, feature prominently in algorithm design. The way they store elements\u2014either in **row-major** or **column-major** order\u2014significantly impacts memory bandwidth and cache coherence during traversal. Row-major facilitates faster row-wise accesses, commonly aligned with loops in algorithmic traversals, while column-major suits columnar iterations typically found in statistical algorithms or graph representations where edges per node or column reflect adjacency. For example, a matrix transpose algorithm in row-major format effectively exploits these properties through nested loop techniques that iterate through the upper triangle of the matrix, swapping off-diagonal elements:\n\n```plaintext\nfor i = 1 to n\n    for j = i+1 to n\n        swap A[i][j], A[j][i]\n```\n\nAnalyzing these operations reveals an inherent $ O(n^2) $ complexity, signifying that every size increase precipitates a quadratic resource requirement\u2014in this case, necessary operations.\n\n---\n\n### Stacks and Queues: Algorithms for Ordered Access\n\nStacks and queues, though simpler in structure than arrays, demonstrate the principles of access constraint. Stacks implement a **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)** discipline, making them the preferred model for recursive algorithms where the most recent state is paramount for computation. They are straightforward to implement with a simple counter or pointer (e.g., `top` in stack mechanics):\n\nIn algorithmic use cases, the stack structure is often deployed in scenarios like backtracking through decision trees, handling function calls in execution models, and parsing expressions in language interpreters. An algorithm implementing stack overflow/underflow protections is critical:\n\n```plaintext\nPUSH(S, x)\n1   if stack S is full\n2       error \"overflow\"\n3   else\n4       top[S] = top + 1\n5       S[top] = x\n```\n\nConversely, queues maintain a **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)** protocol, often used in resource scheduling where the earliest requester gets priority. The array-based queues manage the head and tail efficiently with circular buffers:\n\n```plaintext\nENQUEUE(Q, x)\n1   Q[tail[Q]] = x\n2   if tail[Q] == length[Q]\n3       tail[Q] = 1\n4   else\n5       tail[Q] = tail[Q] + 1\n```\n\nBy continually adjusting the tail and checking sequence boundaries within a loop as shown, the queue ensures each element is processed in order, typically finding use in advanced breadth-first search algorithms or process scheduling systems.\n\n---\n\n### Linked Lists and their Dynamic Characteristics\n\nLinked structures introduce flexibility into algorithm design through nodes that encapsulate data and a reference to subsequent elements. In singly-linked lists, each node tracks only the 'next' node, while doubly-linked lists maintain a 'previous' reference, facilitating backward traversal.\n\nOne of the guiding principles in algorithm design using linked lists is their **dynamic modification capabilities without resource reallocation**. In essence, insertions and deletions within a list of arbitrary size are $O(1)$ if direct pointers to the nodes are held. This efficiency often contrasts with array-based approaches, wherein modifications can incite extensive reallocation.\n\nFor instance, inserting a node 'x' at the head of a list 'L' becomes:\n\n```plaintext\nLIST-INSERT(L, x)\n1   x.next = L.head\n2   if L.head != NIL\n3       L.head.prev = x\n4   L.head = x\n```\n\nWhile facilitating these modifications, **linked lists introduce a different complexity**: random access to nodes within a singly-linked list is inherently linear, which can be computationally expensive for large series. However, the introduction of **sentinel nodes** $L.nil$ simplifies edge case management by guaranteeing a consistent null element presence, permitting cleaner logic for traversal and manipulations. The pseudocode for a `LIST-SEARCH'(L, k)` with sentinel:\n\n```plaintext\nLIST-SEARCH'(L, k)\n1   L.nil.key = k // sentinel guarantees element presence\n2   x = L.nil.next\n3   while x.key != k\n4       x = x.next\n5   if x == L.nil\n6       return NIL\n7   else\n8       return x\n```\ndemonstrates how searches can be made more efficient by avoiding special case checks inside the loop\u2019s body.\n\n---\n\n### Trees: Hierarchical Data Representation\n\nTrees occupy a commanding position in the landscape of algorithmic design as a means of conceptualizing hierarchical relationships. A binary tree node's fundamental operations involve assignment to left or right children, enabling algorithms like:\n```plaintext\nINORDER-TREE-WALK(x)\n1   if x != NIL\n2       INORDER-TREE-WALK(x.left)\n3       print x.key\n4       INORDER-TREE-WALK(x.right)\n```\nThis in-order walk prints keys in ascending order for binary search trees, a pivotal component for key-value databases and search operation modeling.\n\nThe implementation and algorithm design of self-balanced search trees, like **Red-Black Trees**, require operations like `LEFT-ROTATE` to maintain balance while retaining the integrity of the tree\u2019s properties through alterations:\n\n```plaintext\nLEFT-ROTATE(T, x)\n1   y = x.right\n2   x.right = y.left\n3   if y.left != T.nil\n4       y.left.p = x\n5   y.p = x.p\n6   if x.p == T.nil\n7       T.root = y\n8   else if x == x.p.left\n9       x.p.left = y\n10  else\n11      x.p.right = y\n12  y.left = x\n13  x.p = y\n```\nSuch rotation algorithms dynamically restructure the tree to guarantee $O(\\log n)$ complexity for insertion, search, and deletion operations across the dataset, unlike the degrading performance of unguarded binary trees.\n\n---\n\n### Implementing Sets and Analyzing Their Operational Complexities\n\nImplementing dynamic sets in algorithms requires a careful analysis of data structure trade-offs. For example, while an **unsorted array** allows $O(1)$ insertions (assuming appending to the end), its search and deletion operations are $O(n)$. In contrast, a **linked list** can maintain its own order integrity with $O(1)$ insertions when the insertion point is known, while also suffering from linear-time operations for arbitrary accesses.\n\nA deeper consideration for implementing sets arises in the use of **balanced tree structures** or **heap representations** in heap-sort. Maintaining order without degrading efficiency under inserts and deletes, `MIN-HEAP-INSERT` or `MAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX` implement heapsort and priority queues with $O(\\log n)$ operation bounds. For instance, the `HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX` must preserve the heap property after removing the root node:\n\n```plaintext\nMAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX(A)\n1   if heap-size[A] < 1\n2       error \"heap underflow\"\n3   max = A[1]\n4   A[1] = A[heap-size[A]]\n5   heap-size[A] = heap-size[A] - 1\n6   MAX-HEAPIFY(A, 1)\n7   return max\n```\n\nIn summary, mastering elementary data structures and their respective algorithms is essential for effective problem-solving and implementation of advanced algorithmic paradigms. These structures form the backbone of higher-level implementation like graphs and more intricate data constructs\u2014highlighting their universal application across algorithmic development landscapes."

They also noted earlier issues with how the long-form content was presented\u2014sometimes using bullet points when they wanted more narrative sections. I need to structure the chapter 11 summary in clear sections with headings, but using mostly prose and integrating the algorithms into the text rather than listing them separately. Also, they mentioned including the algorithms as per the files provided, so I have to reference the pseudocode from the \"PartIII Data Structures Algorithms.md\" and \"C11 Hash Tables.md\" files.\n\nI should start with the basics of hash tables, explaining direct addressing tables and how they extend from the array-based approach but are limited by the key space size. Then move into hash tables where the size is proportional to stored keys, not all possible keys, introducing hash functions and collision resolution techniques like chaining and open addressing.\n\nFor pseudocode, the user's previous response had the algorithms embedded within the explanation rather than in separate code blocks. Need to mention the procedures from the files: DIRECT-ADDRESS-SEARCH, INSERT, DELETE; CHAINED-HASH-INSERT, SEARCH, and DELETE; then open addressing methods like HASH-INSERT and HASH-SEARCH. Discuss how sentinel nodes or other optimizations might play into these algorithms, as mentioned in the files. Also, elements from \"C11 Hash Tables.md\" like simple uniform hashing, analysis of open addressing techniques, and the use of double hashing for avoiding clustering.\n\nThe user also likes connections between concepts. So I should link hash functions to their impact on collision resolution and how collisions affect the performance of insertions and lookups. Mention universal hashing to mitigate worst-case scenarios intentionally induced by adversarially chosen keys. Perfect hashing\u2019s theoretical $O(1)$ worst-case time for searches is worth a note, though it\u2019s more advanced.\n\nI need to ensure that the structure flows naturally, starting from direct addressing, moving to hash tables, then to collision handling (chaining vs open addressing), hash function design, and finally advanced concepts like perfect hashing. Each section should detail the approach, its benefits, and its limitations within the context of algorithm design.\n\nAlso, from the user's feedback, they want detailed content but avoid bloating with unnecessary information. So I have to ensure each part is explained thoroughly but not overly\u2014connecting algorithms to their use cases without getting bogged down in mathematical proofs unless necessary.\n\nNeed to verify from the user's provided files the correct algorithm names and ensure that they are referenced accurately. For example, the DIRECT-ADDRESS-SEARCH, CHAINED-HASH-INSERT, etc., must be correctly associated with the methods described. Proper recognition of hash function properties like simple uniform hashing and their effect on performance metrics is crucial.\n\nAlso, the user previously preferred long-form content with algorithm steps integrated into the explanation. So instead of blocks of code, the algorithms should be described within the text, possibly with inline pseudocode snippets for key steps.\n\nI should also ensure that concepts like load factor (alpha) are introduced when discussing open addressing and chaining, as they significantly impact performance. Explaining how the load factor affects expected time complexity for operations in different hashing methods ties the theory into practical algorithm efficiency discussions.\n\nAdditionally, touch on real-world concerns like choosing a good hash function (division versus multiplication method, or using open addressing techniques like probing sequences with linear, quadratic, or double hashing), which were mentioned in the data structure files.\n\nCheck that the response does not use markdown bullets for large sections and maintains paragraph form. Each section should be a paragraph or more, explaining the mechanisms, the algorithms involved, and their performance implications without breaking into bullet points unless absolutely necessary for clarity.\n\nMake sure the summary is comprehensive, covering all subsections in chapter 11 as per the files provided\u2014so this means touching on all the various hash table implementations, hash functions, collision resolution methods, and analysis of average vs worst-case behavior.\n\nLastly, wrap up the chapter by discussing when one might choose hash tables over other data structures covered in chapter 10. For instance, their average-case efficiency in insertions, deletions, and lookups compared to logarithmic time offered by balanced trees.\n\nFor all these elements, maintain a balance between ensuring the content is sufficiently detailed and elaborated upon, while adhering to the user's formatting and content preferences. The key is to synthesize chapter 11 into a coherent narrative that dives into hashing mechanics, algorithmic implementations, and their design trade-offs in algorithm development, all while keeping the content within the constraints handed by the user's feedback.\n\n</think>\n\n"

So I should link hash functions to their impact on collision resolution and how collisions affect the performance of insertions and lookups. Mention universal hashing to mitigate worst-case scenarios intentionally induced by adversarially chosen keys. Perfect hashing\u2019s theoretical $O(1)$ worst-case time for searches is worth a note, though it\u2019s more advanced.\n\nI need to ensure that the structure flows naturally, starting from direct addressing, moving to hash tables, then to collision handling (chaining vs open addressing), hash function design, and finally advanced concepts like perfect hashing. Each section should detail the approach, its benefits, and its limitations within the context of algorithm design.\n\nAlso, from the user's feedback, they want detailed content but avoid bloating with unnecessary information. So I have to ensure each part is explained thoroughly but not overly\u2014connecting algorithms to their use cases without getting bogged down in mathematical proofs unless necessary.\n\nNeed to verify from the user's provided files the correct algorithm names and ensure that they are referenced accurately. For example, the DIRECT-ADDRESS-SEARCH, CHAINED-HASH-INSERT, etc., must be correctly associated with the methods described. Proper recognition of hash function properties like simple uniform hashing and their effect on performance metrics is crucial.\n\nAlso, the user previously preferred long-form content with algorithm steps integrated into the explanation. So instead of blocks of code, the algorithms should be described within the text, possibly with inline pseudocode snippets for key steps.\n\nI should also ensure that concepts like load factor (alpha) are introduced when discussing open addressing and chaining, as they significantly impact performance. Explaining how the load factor affects expected time complexity for operations in different hashing methods ties the theory into practical algorithm efficiency discussions.\n\nAdditionally, touch on real-world concerns like choosing a good hash function (division versus multiplication method, or using open addressing techniques like probing sequences with linear, quadratic, or double hashing), which were mentioned in the data structure files.\n\nCheck that the response does not use markdown bullets for large sections and maintains paragraph form. Each section should be a paragraph or more, explaining the mechanisms, the algorithms involved, and their performance implications without breaking into bullet points unless absolutely necessary for clarity.\n\nMake sure the summary is comprehensive, covering all subsections in chapter 11 as per the files provided\u2014so this means touching on all the various hash table implementations, hash functions, collision resolution methods, and analysis of average vs worst-case behavior.\n\nLastly, wrap up the chapter by discussing when one might choose hash tables over other data structures covered in chapter 10. For instance, their average-case efficiency in insertions, deletions, and lookups compared to logarithmic time offered by balanced trees.\n\nFor all these elements, maintain a balance between ensuring the content is sufficiently detailed and elaborated upon, while adhering to the user's formatting and content preferences. The key is to synthesize chapter 11 into a coherent narrative that dives into hashing mechanics, algorithmic implementations, and their design trade-offs in algorithm development, all while keeping the content within the constraints handed by the user's feedback.\n</think>\n\nChapter 11 of *Introduction to Algorithms* dissects the data structure that underpins efficient dictionary implementations: the **hash table**. Hash tables aim to balance accessibility with compactness, enabling $O(1)$ average-case time for operations like insertion, deletion, and search. This efficiency arises from mapping keys to indices via **hash functions**, though performance is inherently tied to **collision resolution strategies** and the quality of the hash function itself. This chapter navigates through variations of this paradigm by comparing **direct addressing** with **chaining** and **open addressing**, illustrating their trade-offs and dependencies on input characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Direct Addressing: A Prelude to Hashing\n\nDirect addressing assumes a set of keys drawn from a sufficiently small universe $U = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, m-1\\}$. When all keys are unique and fit within an array's bounds, this simplicity enables **constant-time operations** by directly using the key as an index. The direct-address table $T[0 \\ldots m-1]$ holds pointers to objects, with `NIL` indicating absent keys. Pseudocode for direct addressing follows a clean format:\n\n```plaintext\nDIRECT-ADDRESS-SEARCH(T, k) \u2192 return T[k]\nDIRECT-ADDRESS-INSERT(T, x) \u2192 T[x.key] = x\nDIRECT-ADDRESS-DELETE(T, x) \u2192 T[x.key] = NIL\n```\n\nWhile conceptually sound and optimal when $m$ is small, direct addressing quickly scales impractically when keys span a large domain. Hash tables emerge as a strategic divergence\u2014by maintaining an array of size proportional to the number of stored keys $n$ (not total possible keys in $U$), memory efficiency improves, though collisions become inevitable.\n\n---\n\n### Hash Tables and Collision Resolution: The Two Principal Strategies\n\nWhen the number of possible keys surpasses available memory or the set of actual keys is sparse, **hashing** is vital to maintain efficiency on manageable memory allocations. A **hash function** maps $U \\rightarrow \\{0, 1, \\ldots, m-1\\}$, reducing key space to a feasible index space. Collisions\u2014where two keys map to the same index\u2014are addressed via two divergent paradigms, the core of chapter 11.\n\n#### Chaining: Linking Collisions with Lists\n\nChaining allows each slot of the hash table $T$ to point to a **linked list** of keys sharing that hash value. Algorithms like `CHAINED-HASH-INSERT`, `CHAINED-HASH-SEARCH`, and `CHAINED-HASH-DELETE` rely on the assumption that the length of a list approximately matches the table\u2019s **average load factor**, $\\alpha = \\frac{n}{m}$, where $n$ is the number of elements and $m$ is the table size. Here\u2019s a glimpse of how these insertions unfold in pseudocode:\n\n```plaintext\nCHAINED-HASH-INSERT(T, x) \u2192 LIST-PREPEND(T[h(x.key)], x)\nCHAINED-HASH-SEARCH(T, k) \u2192 return LIST-SEARCH(T[h(k)], k)\nCHAINED-HASH-DELETE(T, x) \u2192 LIST-DELETE(T[h(x.key)], x)\n```\n\nThe expected time complexity for these operations under **simple uniform hashing**\u2014a theoretical assumption where each key has an equal probability of hashing to any index\u2014deteriorates to $O(\\alpha)$ in the worst-case. However, as long as $m$ scales linearly with $n$, the retrieval and update operations retain acceptable performance. Notably, the decision to implement singly- or doubly-linked (or even sentinel-guarded lists) maps directly to deletion efficiency, as seen in prior chapters.\n\n#### Open Addressing: Slot Probing with Predictability\n\nWhen linked lists are impractical or memory overhead is prohibitive, **open addressing** inserts elements directly into the table itself. For systems demanding compact storage, insertion and lookup require careful probing sequences to find alternative slots when collisions occur. The `HASH-INSERT` and `HASH-SEARCH` functions operate under varied probing strategies (linear, quadratic, double hashing), each shaping the data structure's performance:\n\n```plaintext\nHASH-INSERT(T, k) : while ... compute h(k, i); T[i] = k;\nHASH-SEARCH(T, k) : while ... check for key match at h(k, i)\n```\n\nThe expected number of probes is analyzable via a series of probabilistic models for successful and unsuccessful searches. **Linear probing**\u2014where $h(k,i) = (h(k) + i) \\mod m$\u2014is memory-efficient but suffers from **primary clustering**, while **double hashing** uses two hash functions to yield less clustering:\n\n$$\nh(k,i) = (h_1(k) + i \\cdot h_2(k)) \\mod m\n$$\n\nAnalysis hinges on the load factor $\\alpha < 1$ for open addressing, reflecting that the frequency of collisions increases with it. Under uniform hashing assumptions, searching incurs an expected time of $O(\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha})$ for **unsuccessful** searches. For $m$ slots and $n$ inserts, this degrades gracefully as $\\alpha \\rightarrow 1$, but remains favorable compared to chaining for small $\\alpha$ values.\n\n---\n\n### Designing Hash Functions: From Simplicity to Resilience\n\nHash functions dictate a hash table\u2019s performance and must distribute keys uniformly with minimal **worst-case skew**, a critical role in avoiding adversary-induced worst-case behavior. Two pivotal approaches emerge:\n\n1. **Division Method**: $h(k) = k \\mod m$ is simple but vulnerable to key-patterns that align with hash size $m$.\n2. **Multiplication Method**: $h(k) = \\lfloor m (kA \\mod 1) \\rfloor$ reduces pattern sensitivity through an empirical constant $A = 0.6180339887...$\u2014a portion of the golden ratio.\n\nTo defend against adversarial inputs, **universal hashing** becomes critical, selecting a randomly chosen hash function from a predefined family $H$ for any new table. This approach randomizes the probability distribution of collisions, preventing deterministic patterns that yield poor performance.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Techniques and Theoretical Extremes\n\nBeyond practical implementations, theoretical benchmarks for perfect hashing round out the chapter. Utilizing a two-level scheme where the primary table hashes to secondary tables\u2014each with constant-time lookup\u2014saturates $O(1)$ worst-case insert, delete, and search costs. This level of ambition proves beneficial in static or preprocessed datasets where lookup speed is paramount, but the overhead of constructing such a scheme limits its real-time applicability.\n\n---\n\n### Making the Call: Hash Tables in Context\n\nTransitioning from the constrained memory patterns of Chapter 10, hash tables typify the leap from determinism in primitive data structures to **randomization in effective algorithms**. Chaining aligns with flexible storage needs where key distributions are unpredictable. Open addressing, with its cache-friendly probing, accelerates performance on certain CPU architectures at the cost of increased complexity in handling collisions.\n\nGiven the implications for time complexity in real-world algorithms spanning cache implementation to database indexes, hash tables stand as a pivotal mechanism in algorithmic design. Their performance hinges on the **quality of hash functions, collision resolution method, and load factor control**, encapsulating the essence of balancing space-time trade-offs through probabilistic modeling and strategic data structure design. Thus, the pursuit of optimal hashing is not merely a coding concern but a theoretical framework for optimizing algorithm performance amid finite resources."

BSTs allow for keys to be arranged such that for any node $x$, all keys in the left subtree \u2264 $x.key$ and all keys in the right subtree \u2265 $x.key$, enabling sorting via traversal and efficient range queries. This chapter explores the mechanisms by which this structure supports **dynamic set operations** and sets the stage for more sophisticated variations\u2014for example, red-black trees in Chapter 13.\n\n---\n\n## Binary Search Tree Properties and In-Order Traversal\n\nEach node in a binary search tree contains a key, a reference to the left and right subtrees, and\u2014if part of a deletion algorithm\u2014its parent. These trees allow **comparison-based operations**, where keys dictate both placement and retrieval. A binary search tree preserves the **symmetric order** property: an **in-order traversal** results in a monotonically non-decreasing sequence of keys. The recursive `INORDER-TREE-WALK` pseudocode for non-empty trees begins in the leftmost subtree and ends in the rightmost subtree:\n\n```plaintext\nINORDER-TREE-WALK(x)\n    if x \u2260 NIL\n        INORDER-TREE-WALK(x.left)\n        print x.key\n        INORDER-TREE-WALK(x.right)\n```\n\nEach subtree\u2019s local in-order traversal ensures that the accumulated sequence of keys forms a sorted output of size $n$ in $O(n)$ time. This traversal is the bedrock upon which augmented operations rest, including augmented trees used in range queries and augmented priority queues, aligning with the broader theme of efficiency through ordered decomposition.\n\n---\n\n## Tree Search: Navigating Within the Structure\n\nTwo principal algorithms for iterating within the structure are provided\u2014`TREE-SEARCH` for recursive descent through a binary search tree and `ITERATIVE-TREE-SEARCH`, which performs the same task iteratively. Both operate on a key and node with expected $O(h)$ worst-case time complexity, where h is the height of the tree\u2014a critical determinant in per-operation cost. The recurrence is straightforward; when the key at node $x$ does not match the target, the structure necessitates descending into one of two branches:\n\n```plaintext\nTREE-SEARCH(x, k)\n    if x == NIL or k == x.key\n        return x\n    if k < x.key\n        return TREE-SEARCH(x.left, k)\n    else\n        return TREE-SEARCH(x.right, k)\n```\n\nThe recursive solution serves as the conceptual basis for traversing binary search trees and will be foundational in analyzing the expected complexity of the more intrusive operations like insertions and deletions that augment the tree\u2019s state.\n\n```plaintext\nITERATIVE-TREE-SEARCH(x, k)\n    while x \u2260 NIL and k \u2260 x.key\n        if k < x.key\n            x = x.left\n        else x = x.right\n    return x\n```\n\nBoth recursion and iteration demonstrate the essence of the comparison model applied to dynamic sets, with nontrivial implications for worst-case performance, particularly in imbalanced configurations. The iterative version is commonly favored in environments where recursion depth is constrained\u2014such as in hardware with shallow call stacks or in embedded system implementations.\n\n---\n\n## Insertion into Binary Search Trees: Adding Nodes With Precision\n\nNew nodes are inscribed within the BST's structure through `TREE-INSERT`, which ensures the comparability property dictates placement. Atypical of balanced tree implementations, `TREE-INSERT` traverses from the root downward, tracking the current subtree's parent $y$ as it descends to position $x$ in the appropriate spot. The algorithm is outlined as follows:\n\n```plaintext\nTREE-INSERT(T, z)\n    y = NIL\n    x = T.root\n    while x \u2260 NIL\n        y = x\n        if z.key < x.key\n            x = x.left\n        else x = x.right\n    z.p = y\n    if y == NIL\n        T.root = z\n    else\n        if z.key < y.key\n            y.left = z\n        else y.right = z\n```\n\nThis algorithm introduces two variables: $x$ represents the current node traversed, and $y$ acts as its predecessor to aid in reference establishment. Starting with the root, the algorithm descends while comparing keys\u2014moving left or right depending on whether the new key is smaller or larger. Once the traversal terminates, reconfiguration of the tree\u2019s properties ensures the node $z$ is placed properly, maintaining in-order comparability. Insertion time is bounded by traversal depth; however, without balancing mechanisms, worst-case performance on sorted input degrades to $O(n)$ as the tree becomes a linked list.  \n\n---\n\n## Deletion in Binary Search Trees: Structural Integrity Amid Change\n\nPreserving the BST invariant during deletions requires a **multifaceted approach**, encapsulated in `TREE-DELETE`, which is conditional upon the number and structure of a node\u2019s children. The algorithm relies on replacement strategies that guarantee **subtree structure**\u2014specifically, how to handle cases where deletion causes structural changes:\n\n```plaintext\nTRANSPLANT(T, u, v)\n    if u.p == NIL\n        T.root = v\n    else if u == u.p.left\n        u.p.left = v\n    else u.p.right = v\n    if v \u2260 NIL\n        v.p = u.p\n```\n\nThis `TRANSPLANT` function is used by `TREE-DELETE` to simplify pointer updates when replacing nodes. While preserving order properties, `TREE-DELETE` manages three deletion scenarios within the tree:\n\n1.  **Node has no left child**: Can transplant the entire right subtree.\n2.  **Node has a left child, but no right child**: The left subtree of the node being deleted takes its place; reformation of parent links follows.\n3.  **Node has two children**: The node must find a surrogate\u2014an in-order successor\u2014to replace it, and this surrogate is subject to its own deletion, typically with fewer children. `TREE-MINIMUM` locates the successor. \n\n```plaintext\nTREE-DELETE(T, z)\n    if z.left == NIL\n        TRANSPLANT(T, z, z.right)\n    else if z.right == NIL\n        TRANSPLANT(T, z, z.left)\n    else\n        y = TREE-MINIMUM(z.right)\n        if y.p != z\n            TRANSPLANT(T, y, y.right)\n            y.right = z.right\n            y.right.p = y\n        TRANSPLANT(T, z, y)\n        y.left = z.left\n        y.left.p = y\n```\n\nThe process demonstrates the nuanced interplay between tree reorganization and algorithm design, where each case must respect parent and sibling references while ensuring the original binary search property is upheld. Because this can involve up to three traversals (for locating the minimum and restructuring), complexity increases with the tree's depth $h$, which remains a hidden variable in BST performance profiles absent augmenting structural constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Time Complexity and Binary Tree Analysis Throughout Chapter 12\n\nUnder the best-case scenario of a perfectly balanced tree, operations in Chapter 12 illustrate $O(\\log n)$ complexity. However, in the worst-case of a completely **unbalanced** tree, which, for example, occurs when elements are inserted in **ascending order**, leading to a tree resembling a singly-linked list, complexity degrades to **O(n)**. The average-case performance aligns with the balanced expectations, provided keys are randomly inserted. Insertion and deletion use multiple iterations\u2014traversals\u2014through the tree before modifying links or rebalancing. These iterations ensure correctness but highlight the necessity of self-balancing constructs like **red-black trees (Chapter 13)** and **AVL trees**, which maintain optimal height and performance regardless of insertion order.\n\nBinary search tree searches perform comparably to many array-based and linked list operations; however, without balancing, operations do not maintain consistent efficiency. The algorithms detailed here lack mechanisms to guarantee persistent balance but focus correctly on mechanisms that maintain the binary search property while enforcing structured node movement within a dynamically changing set.\n\nThe algorithms address multiple variations, from tree walks (in-order, pre-order, and post-order), tree searches that match either of a given recursive or iterative nature, insert, and delete, each requiring **seamless transition** between parent and child links. Each of these operations is bound by tree height\u2014a metric that fluctuates with data order and structure. As Chapter 13 delves into modifications that guarantee balanced performance, the focus here remains on operations that expose vulnerabilities of naively constructed binary trees\u2014particularly in time complexity sensitivity to node disposition.\n\nUltimately, this chapter systematically **defines the BST as a prototypical hierarchical structure** and serves as the groundwork for complex extensions in an ever-evolving algorithm landscape, particularly those that address and correct for skew present in unchecked binary tree operations."

Let\u2019s recall the question at hand. The original problem is about creating rigorous study notes for Part III of the book, but the user has expanded the scope to cover all chapters, including Chapter 13. They want detailed, long-form content including pseudocode, algorithms, and performance considerations. They\u2019re clearly a serious student of algorithms, possibly a grad student or a professional honing their theoretical edge. The prompt enforces strict markdown formatting and a balance between plain text and structure, ensuring that the output is educational and aligns precisely with academic and practical algorithmic demands.\n\nChapter 13 of \"Introduction to Algorithms\" introduces **Red-Black Trees**, which are self-balancing binary search trees. In contrast to the binary search trees in Chapter 12, Red-Black Trees guarantee **O(log n) complexity** for insertion, deletion, and search operations. This chapter builds upon previous notions of BSTs by addressing imbalance through structural invariants\u2014constraints that maintain efficient asymptotic bounds even for worst-case input.\n\nThe challenge is to explore red-black tree properties, the insertion and deletion algorithms that preserve these properties, and, most crucially, their performance implications within the red-black tree framework without using any markdown.\n\nRed-Black Trees maintain balance by adhering to a strict set of properties:\n1. Each node is either red or black.\n2. The **root** is **black**.\n3. Every **leaf (NIL)** is black.\n4. If a node is red, **both its children are black**. No red-red parent-child chain.\n5. For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the **same number of black nodes**.\n\nThese properties, when maintained through insertion and deletion, ensure that the tree\u2019s height remains logarithmically bounded\u2014achieved with a cost of insertion/deletion operations that include not just BST-style tree modifications but also **rotations and recoloring**, which are the bedrock red-black algorithms.\n\nRed-Black insertions proceed by first setting a newly inserted node to be red, preserving black-height property 5 while risking property 4 (when parent is also red). Cases of violation are resolved through **recoloring**, tree rotations (single or double), and their symmetric counterparts. **RB-INSERT-FIXUP** plays a central role here:\n\n```plaintext\nRB-INSERT-FIXUP(T, z)  \n    while z.p.color == RED\n        if z.p == z.p.p.left:\n            y = z.p.p.right\n            if y.color == RED:\n                z.p.color = BLACK\n                y.color = BLACK\n                z.p.p.color = RED\n                z = z.p.p\n            else:\n                if z == z.p.right:\n                    z = z.p\n                    LEFT-ROTATE(T, z)\n                z.p.color = BLACK\n                z.p.p.color = RED\n                RIGHT-ROTATE(T, z.p.p)\n        else (symmetric cases for z.p as a right child)\n    T.root.color = BLACK\n```\n\nThis algorithm resolves violation of the red-black properties generated by insertion, through three potential cases\u2014each resolving increasingly complex tree configurations via color changes, left/right rotations, and structural reorganization.\n\nSimilarly, **deletions** modify the BST delete to account for red-black properties. Removal of a node requires a fixup, **RB-DELETE-FIXUP**, to reestablish properties:\n\n```plaintext\nRB-DELETE-FIXUP(T, x)\n    while x \u2260 T.root and x.color == BLACK:\n        if x is a left child of w = x.p.right:\n            if w.color == RED:\n                w.color = BLACK, x.p.color = RED, LEFT-ROTATE(T, x.p), ...\n            if w.left.color == BLACK and w.right.color == BLACK:\n                w.color = RED, x = x.p\n            else if w.right.color == BLACK:\n                ... apply RIGHT-ROTATE(T, w), ...\n                ... recolor and LEFT-ROTATE(T, x.p)\n    x.color = BLACK\n```\n\n**Red-Black Trees** maintain balance via rotation operations such as `LEFT-ROTATE`, which alters structure without disturbing the BST property. Here\u2019s pseudocode for one such routine:\n\n```plaintext\nLEFT-ROTATE(T, x):\n    y = x.right   // right child, y, becomes new parent of x\n    x.right = y.left  // y\u2019s left subtree becomes x\u2019s right\n    if y.left \u2260 T.NIL:\n        y.left.p = x\n    y.p = x.p\n    if x.p == T.NIL:\n        T.root = y\n    else if x == x.p.left:\n        x.p.left = y\n    else:\n        x.p.right = y\n    y.left = x\n    x.p = y\n```\n\nWith red-black trees in place, the discussion transitions to algorithm complexity through both insertions and deletions. Both operations start with standard BST operations, with fix-ups taking up at most a constant number of rotations per level. Analysis confirms that the **height is at most two times log base of the black-height**, leading to **O(log n)** worst-case time for insertion, deletion, and search\u2014superior to the potential linear degradation of their unbalanced binary tree predecessors.\n\nChapter 13 does more than clarify red-black trees; it frames them as the critical answer to the efficiency decay that was the case for arbitrary BST usage. While the algorithms explicitly reveal the recursive nature of the insert/delete operations, the real power emerges through code design that **gains the high watermark for dynamic set optimizations**, ensuring that algorithms relying on these structures benefit from balanced and **consistent performance across a broad spectrum of operational scenarios**.\n\nTherefore, Chapter 13 provides the robust mechanisms necessary to fulfill Chapter 12\u2019s promise of $O(\\log n)$ average-case operations. Understanding the interplay of color rules, tree rotations, and fix-up logic underlines a core pedagogical aim\u2014providing the tools to ensure that hierarchical data manipulation proceeds predictably, efficiently, and scalably, reinforcing the broader algorithmic aims articulated in Parts I to III of the book. With red-black trees thoroughly established, subsequent enhancements, like self-optimizing splay trees or augmented trees, become logical continuations of a rich tree architecture that **equates theoretical soundness with practical implementation precision.**\n\nThe takeaway is unequivocal: Red-Black Trees are no mere exercise in theoretical balance; they embody the integration of rigorous color-based pruning with smart structural adjustments\u2014crafting a framework where **every inserted or removed node respects a compact, balanced structure**, ensuring a level of predictability and stability that algorithmic applications require.\n\nFrom an educational standpoint, the journey through Chapter 13 moves the learner from an appreciation of tree structures\u2019 simplicity in preceding chapters to a nuanced understanding of how algorithmic constraints can be enforced to **maintain functionality while upholding performance expectations**\u2014a critical layer that prepares the practitioner to confront a wealth of problems in database system indexing, memory management, and real-time computing environments.  \nIf each algorithm in prior chapters posed a step toward understanding complexity, red-black trees represent a **leap towards mastery**, where the theoretical and the practical in data structure design achieve their synthesis, propelling the student from appreciative knowledge to actionable expertise in algorithmic design.\n\nThus, Chapter 13 is not simply another read in a series\u2014it frames a **transition through which effective algorithm design is not just possible but assured**, setting a precedent for balanced tree structures to follow in subsequent parts of the text.

Let\u2019s recall the question at hand. The original problem is about creating rigorous study notes for Part III of the book, but the user has expanded the scope to cover all chapters, including Chapter 13. They want detailed, long-form content including pseudocode, algorithms, and performance considerations. They\u2019re clearly a serious student of algorithms, possibly a grad student or a professional honing their theoretical edge. The prompt enforces strict markdown formatting and a balance between plain text and structure, ensuring that the output is educational and aligns precisely with academic and practical algorithmic demands.\n\nChapter 13 of \"Introduction to Algorithms\" introduces **Red-Black Trees**, which are self-balancing binary search trees. In contrast to the binary search trees in Chapter 12, Red-Black Trees guarantee **O(log n) complexity** for insertion, deletion, and search operations. This chapter builds upon previous notions of BSTs by addressing imbalance through structural invariants\u2014constraints that maintain efficient asymptotic bounds even for worst-case input.\n\nThe challenge is to explore red-black tree properties, the insertion and deletion algorithms that preserve these properties, and, most crucially, their performance implications within the red-black tree framework without using any markdown.\n\nRed-Black Trees maintain balance by adhering to a strict set of properties:\n1. Each node is either red or black.\n2. The **root** is **black**.\n3. Every **leaf (NIL)** is black.\n4. If a node is red, **both its children are black**. No red-red parent-child chain.\n5.

Cases of violation are resolved through **recoloring**, tree rotations (single or double), and their symmetric counterparts. **RB-INSERT-FIXUP** plays a central role here:\n\n```plaintext\nRB-INSERT-FIXUP(T, z)  \n    while z.p.color == RED\n        if z.p == z.p.p.left:\n            y = z.p.p.right\n            if y.color == RED:\n                z.p.color = BLACK\n                y.color = BLACK\n                z.p.p.color = RED\n                z = z.p.p\n            else:\n                if z == z.p.right:\n                    z = z.p\n                    LEFT-ROTATE(T, z)\n                z.p.color = BLACK\n                z.p.p.color = RED\n                RIGHT-ROTATE(T, z.p.p)\n        else (symmetric cases for z.p as a right child)\n    T.root.color = BLACK\n```\n\nThis algorithm resolves violation of the red-black properties generated by insertion, through three potential cases\u2014each resolving increasingly complex tree configurations via color changes, left/right rotations, and structural reorganization.\n\nSimilarly, **deletions** modify the BST delete to account for red-black properties. Removal of a node requires a fixup, **RB-DELETE-FIXUP**, to reestablish properties:\n\n```plaintext\nRB-DELETE-FIXUP(T, x)\n    while x \u2260 T.root and x.color == BLACK:\n        if x is a left child of w = x.p.right:\n            if w.color == RED:\n                w.color = BLACK, x.p.color = RED, LEFT-ROTATE(T, x.p), ...\n            if w.left.color == BLACK and w.right.color == BLACK:\n                w.color = RED, x = x.p\n            else if w.right.color == BLACK:\n                ... apply RIGHT-ROTATE(T, w), ...\n                ... recolor and LEFT-ROTATE(T, x.p)\n    x.color = BLACK\n```\n\n**Red-Black Trees** maintain balance via rotation operations such as `LEFT-ROTATE`, which alters structure without disturbing the BST property. Here\u2019s pseudocode for one such routine:\n\n```plaintext\nLEFT-ROTATE(T, x):\n    y = x.right   // right child, y, becomes new parent of x\n    x.right = y.left  // y\u2019s left subtree becomes x\u2019s right\n    if y.left \u2260 T.NIL:\n        y.left.p = x\n    y.p = x.p\n    if x.p == T.NIL:\n        T.root = y\n    else if x == x.p.left:\n        x.p.left = y\n    else:\n        x.p.right = y\n    y.left = x\n    x.p = y\n```\n\nWith red-black trees in place, the discussion transitions to algorithm complexity through both insertions and deletions.

This chapter builds upon and resolves the inefficiencies of basic binary search trees (BSTs) addressed in Chapter 12, where unbalanced trees degraded performance to $O(n)$. While the first principles of binary search trees are preserved\u2014efficiency of tree ordering and comparisons\u2014the Red-Black Tree enforces **additional structural constraints** to maintain predictable logarithmic runtime bounds for dynamic set operations.\n\nThe key to the **red-black balancing act** lies in a set of **five structural constraints**, which any node and tree configuration must maintain. These properties are interwoven with the algorithm design of insertions and deletions to consistently uphold balance:\n\n1. **Every node is either red or black.**\n2. **The root is black.**\n3. **Every leaf (nil) is black.**\n4. **If a node is red, both its children are black.**\n5. **For any node, all paths from the node to its descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.**\n\nAt the core of these properties is the concept of **black-height**\u2014the number of black nodes on any path from a node to any of its leaves. Property 5 ensures that the **black-height is uniform across the tree**, enforcing a balance that limits deviations in the vertical dimension. Because red nodes do not contribute to this height measurement (only black nodes are counted), even with red nodes, tree height remains bounded by $2\\log(n+1)$, anchoring the performance guarantees.\n\n## Algorithms Behind the Red-Black Framework\nRed-Black Trees rely on a suite of rotation and recoloring operations to preserve the structural properties during updates. These subroutines\u2014`LEFT-ROTATE` and `RIGHT-ROTATE`\u2014are the backbone of local restructuring within the tree and are used extensively during insertion and deletion processes.\n\n```plaintext  \nLEFT-ROTATE(T, x)  \n    y = x.right               // right child, y, becomes the new root  \n    x.right = y.left         // set x's right child to y's left subtree  \n    if y.left \u2260 T.nil:  \n        y.left.p = x        // set x as parent if y's left subtree is non-empty  \n    y.p = x.p                // establish parent relationships for y  \n    if x.p == T.nil:  \n        T.root = y  \n    else if x == x.p.left:  \n        x.p.left = y  \n    else:  \n        x.p.right = y  \n    y.left = x                // y's left becomes x  \n    x.p = y                   // x\u2019s parent is now y  \n\nRIGHT-ROTATE mirrors this logic symmetrically across the tree\u2019s orientation, exchanging left and right references.  \n```\n\nThese operations rearrange node relationships while preserving the **BST property**, serving as the essential tool for balancing that occurs **after structural changes** from insertions and deletions.\n\n## Insertion with $O(\\log n)$ Guarantees\n\nInsertions in Red-Black Trees adhere to two sequential phases: \n\n1. **Standard BST insertion**, akin to Chapter 12's `TREE-INSERT`, places a node $(z)$ as a red node.  \n2. **Red-black property restoration** through recoloring and rotations, using algorithms like `RB-INSERT-FIXUP(T, z)` to ensure all properties remain intact.  \n\n```plaintext  \nRB-INSERT(T, z):  \n    y = T.nil  \n    x = T.root  \n    while x \u2260 T.nil:                // locate z\u2019s ultimate parent  \n        y = x  \n        if z.key < x.key  \n            x = x.left  \n        else x = x.right  \n    z.p = y                           // z\u2019s parent is the last non-nil encountered  \n    if y == T.nil:                   // tree was empty  \n        T.root = z  \n    elif z.key < y.key:  \n        y.left = z  \n    else y.right = z  \n    z.left = T.nil                  // z is a new leaf  \n    z.right = T.nil  \n    z.color = RED                   // initialize to red to preserve property 5  \n    RB-INSERT-FIXUP(T, z)         // restore red-black properties  \n```\n\nOnce a new node is inserted as a red node, `RB-INSERT-FIXUP` addresses possible violations of property **4**, triggered by parent-grandparent-red conflicts. The fix involves a **case analysis** where four of the cases are symmetric mirror image counterparts, and the repair logic alternates between recolorings (changing colors) and restructuring through rotations.\n\nA vivid demonstration of the structured update process occurs when the **parent** and **uncle** of insert `z` are both red. `RB-INSERT-FIXUP` adjusts colors of these relative nodes without requiring shape alterations. The logic unfolds in three cases, with several steps reversing color states and ascending the correction upward in the tree akin to rebalancing efforts in a recursive descent.\n\nThe pseudocode-driven approach of `RB-INSERT-FIXUP` exemplifies the **refinement and evolution of BST operations** as presented in Chapter 12, integrating procedural balance maintenance without compromising runtime rigor.\n\n## Deletion Under the Red-Black Framework\n\nDeletion in Red-Black Trees demands meticulous management far beyond binary search trees. Much like `RB-INSERT-FIXUP` reacts to violations introduced by insertions, the `RB-DELETE-FIXUP` tackles the fallout from node removal that can potentially expose the previously buried imbalances.\n\nKey to the algorithm is determining **which node (z)** is **physically removed** and which (y) **substitutes** z given the presence or absence of left or right subtrees:\n\n```plaintext  \nRB-DELETE(T, z)  \n    y = z                     // y tracks the node removed from the tree  \n    y-original-color = y.color  \n    if z.left == T.nil:   \n        x = z.right  \n        RB-TRANSPLANT(T, z, z.right)  \n    elif z.right == T.nil:  \n        x = z.left  \n        RB-TRANSPLANT(T, z, z.left)  \n    else:  \n        y = TREE-MINIMUM(z.right)  \n        y-original-color = y.color  \n        x = y.right  \n        if y.p == z:        // y is z's child  \n            x.p = y  \n        else  \n            RB-TRANSPLANT(T, y, y.right)   \n            // Substitute y's right child for y  \n            y.right = z.right  \n            y.right.p = y  \n        RB-TRANSPLANT(T, z, y)  \n        y.left = z.left  \n        y.left.p = y  \n        y.color = z.color  // Carry forward z's color  \n    if y-original-color == BLACK  \n        RB-DELETE-FIXUP(T, x)  \n```\n\nHere, `RB-TRANSPLANT`, adapted from Chapter 12, simplifies manipulation of node parents during replacement. The presence of `x`\u2014the node that moves into the position formerly occupied by `y`\u2014is tracked to determine if balancing is necessary post-deletion.\n\nThe actual restructuring and coloring undertaken in `RB-DELETE-FIXUP(T, x)` tackles the rare but critical instances where deletion disrupts the **black-height** balance\u2014as when a black node is removed, requiring subsequent structural modifications to **maintain equal black depth across all terminal paths**. Much like `RB-INSERT-FIXUP`, this procedure handles several **asymmetrical cases** as x ascends in the tree, again necessitating **left-right and right-left** transformations that restore black-height equilibrium.\n\n## Red-Black Tree Performance Guarantees  \nRed-Black Trees ensure that for dynamic sets, **amortized operations** do not exceed $O(\\log n)$ latency. Here\u2019s how:\n\n1. **Insertion**: One insertion requires at most **two rotations**, with other changes occurring through straightforward recoloring. No case analysis necessitates more than $O(\\log n)$ black-height changes due to iterated fixing propagating upward.  \n2. **Deletion**: As with insertions, updates post-deletion never require more than **three rotations**, regardless of the path ascending from the fixup base case to re-normalize the tree for property adherence.\n\nThe algorithm\u2019s **logarithmic scaling** stands in stark contrast with the unbalanced BSTs where the worst-case time complexity degrades to $O(n)$. This enhancement originates from the **dual role of insertions and color management**, maintaining that the maximum height of the tree never exceeds $2\\log(n+1)$\u2014thereby guaranteeing predictable performance.\n\n## Mastering Binary Trees Beyond Chapter 12  \nRed-Black Trees present both architectural and algorithmic progress beyond the limitations of Chapter 12\u2019s binary search trees, **leveraging additional data (color)** to enforce tree height guarantees:\n\n- The previously unpredictable structural vulnerabilities in Chapter 12 are now bounded deterministically, relying on properties that **tightly control the tree's height**.\n- Rotation-based restructuring, while foundational in principle, is now **combined with color rules** to preserve structural invariants across all operations.\n\nBy layering **insertion and deletion** techniques within a rigid structural grammar, the utility of tree structures as containers for dynamic data is **intrinsically enhanced**. The tree's guarantee of maintaining structural balance underpins its superiority in implementing self-adjusting data structures beyond elementary design principles present in naive binary trees.\n\nThus, **Chapter 13 firmly establishes Red-Black Trees as the preferred choice** in applications demanding stable logarithmic time complexity. Whether implementing **symbol tables**, **priority queues**, or **associative arrays** in performance-sensitive environments, Red-Black Trees ensure that despite insertions and deletions, efficiency remains intact\u2014a definitive reconfiguration of the trade-offs familiarized in Chapter 12.\n\nThe reader\u2019s understanding of advanced dynamic set operations reaches new echelons with Red-Black Trees, offering a comprehensive encapsulation of **tree balancing**, **color management**, and **rotation logic**, while serving as a stepping stone toward exploring **more intricate self-balancing constructs** in algorithm design."
