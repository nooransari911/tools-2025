It's often used in logical arguments or formal reasoning.\n- \"Therefore,\" \"thus,\" and \"hence\" are more common in everyday English usage.\n- None is inherently \"superior\" - they have different tones and slightly different connotations in usage.\n\n\"Ergo\" might be perceived as more sophisticated or intellectual simply because it's Latin and less common in casual speech, but that doesn't make it inherently better - just different in tone and appropriate in different contexts.\n\nI'll provide a direct, concise answer about what \"ergo\" means and how it compares to the other terms mentioned.",
