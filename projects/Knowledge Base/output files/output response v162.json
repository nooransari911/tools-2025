It shows how taxpayers fund key tech, rich donors control politics via Super PACs, and capitalist countries still suffer widespread hunger. It highlights how capitalism privatizes profits from public risk and relies heavily on state bailouts and subsidies for the rich.",
        "summary": "You hear capitalism is great and socialism is awful. This piece flips that script. It takes common criticisms of socialism and shows how they actually fit, often better, with how modern capitalism works, especially the neoliberal kind. Think taxpayer-funded tech profits for corporations, billionaires buying politics, or government bailouts for banks. It argues the system socializes the costs while privatizing the benefits."
