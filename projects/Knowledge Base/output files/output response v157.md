# Project Management Study Notes

# Introduction to Project Management

Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements. It involves planning, organizing, securing, managing, leading, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals.

## Key Components of a Project Plan

A well-defined project plan is crucial for guiding a project towards successful completion. Key components of such a plan typically include:
-   Scope definition: This involves clearly delineating the project's boundaries, specifying what the project aims to accomplish and what it will not. This clarity is essential for preventing scope creep, which is the uncontrolled expansion of project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources.
-   Objective setting: Objectives guide the project's direction and provide a benchmark for measuring success. They should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART).
-   Resource allocation: This component focuses on identifying all necessary resources, which can include human resources (team members with specific skills), financial resources (budget), and material resources (equipment, software, facilities). Efficient allocation of these resources is key to project execution.
-   Timelines: Detailed schedules are created to manage deadlines and understand dependencies between tasks. These timelines are often visualized using tools like Gantt charts or project management software, which help in tracking progress and managing project milestones.

# Organizational Structures and Issues

## Definitions of Organization and Organization Structure
An organization is an entity where the efforts of a group of individuals are deliberately structured and coordinated to achieve a common set of objectives. It represents the formal system that brings together people and resources to accomplish these objectives, enabling cohesive and effective operation.

Organization structure is the formal framework defining how tasks are divided, resources are deployed, and activities are coordinated within an organization. This framework establishes the reporting relationships, lines of authority, responsibility, accountability, and communication pathways necessary to achieve the organization's objectives. Organizations are groups of people whose activities must be coordinated to meet objectives, requiring strong communication and understanding of interdependencies.

## Evolution of Organizational Structures
Organizational structures have evolved significantly, driven by the need for adaptability in response to changing environments. Management has recognized that organizations must be dynamic and capable of rapid restructuring if environmental conditions dictate.
-   Key drivers for this evolution include:
    -   Heightened market competitiveness.
    -   Rapid technological advancements and the variety of products.
    -   The requirement for better resource management in firms with multiple products.
-   Historically, Wallace identified four major factors contributing to the organizational revolution:
    -   The technology revolution: Marked by product complexity, new materials, new processes, and extensive research.
    -   Competition and profit squeeze: Stemming from saturated markets, inflation of wage and material costs, and the drive for production efficiency.
    -   High marketing costs.
    -   Unpredictable consumer demands: Influenced by higher incomes, a wide range of choices available, and shifting tastes.

Organizations continuously adapt their structures, which can alter individual roles within both formal and informal systems. Even minor changes, such as creating a new position, needing better planning, adjusting the span of control, requiring new technology (knowledge), or shifting towards centralization or decentralization, can induce major conflicts and changes in the sociotechnical subsystem.

## Factors Shaping Organizational Structures
The design of an organizational structure is influenced by several factors:
-   Technology and its pace of change.
-   Complexity of tasks and the operational environment.
-   Availability of resources.
-   Nature of products or services offered.
-   Competitive pressures in the market.
-   Decision-making requirements of the organization.

A poorly restructured organization can sever established communication channels, disrupt the informal organization leading to new power dynamics, and negatively impact job satisfaction and motivation.

## Key Definitions in Organizational Structure
Understanding the following terms is essential when discussing organizational structures:
-   Authority: This is the power, often granted by virtue of a position, to make final decisions.
-   Responsibility: This refers to the obligation incurred by individuals in their formal roles to effectively perform assigned tasks.
-   Accountability: This means being answerable for the satisfactory completion of a specific assignment. Accountability generally encompasses both authority and responsibility.

Establishing effective working relationships between project managers and functional managers can be particularly challenging, especially when an organization is transitioning from a traditional structure to a more project-oriented one.

## Types of Organizational Structures

The choice of organizational structure significantly impacts how projects are managed and executed. Different structures offer varying degrees of project manager authority, resource availability, and integration.

### 1. Traditional or Classical (Functional) Organization
The traditional management structure, also known as a functional organization, has been prevalent for centuries. It groups employees based on specialized functional areas, such as engineering, operations, finance, administration, and marketing. Each function has a clear hierarchical line of command.
-   Advantages:
    -   Easier budgeting and cost control within functional departments.
    -   Strong technical control and grouping of specialists, which facilitates knowledge sharing.
    -   Personnel can be utilized across multiple projects, benefiting from advanced technology and efficient use of scarce personnel.
    -   Flexibility in manpower use and a broad base of available talent.
    -   Continuity in functional disciplines with clearly defined policies, procedures, and lines of responsibility.
    -   Suitable for mass production activities with established specifications.
    -   Good control over personnel, as each employee reports to a single manager.
    -   Well-established vertical communication channels.
    -   Capable of quick reactions, though this may depend on functional managers' priorities.
-   Disadvantages:
    -   No single individual is directly responsible for the entire project; formal project authority is lacking, often leading to committee-based solutions.
    -   Does not inherently provide project-oriented emphasis.
    -   Coordination across functions can be complex, leading to longer decision-making lead times.
    -   Decisions may favor the strongest functional groups.
    -   Lack of a single customer focal point, resulting in slower responses to customer needs.
    -   Difficulty in pinpointing responsibility for project outcomes due to limited direct project reporting and authority.
    -   Can decrease motivation and innovation, with ideas tending to be functionally oriented rather than project-focused.

### 2. Departmental Organization Structure
This structure involves a division manager overseeing various departments (e.g., Department X, Y, Z). Within each department, project leaders manage projects at the section level. This is a variation of the functional structure where projects are contained within departments.

### 3. Line-Staff Organization (Project Coordinator)
In this model, the project manager (or coordinator) typically lacks formal line authority over functional departments. Their role is to coordinate project activities across these departments. Communication and influence often rely on informal authority or information flow. The project coordinator acts as a staff assistant to a higher-level manager, helping to plan and coordinate the project. This form is often used when a project requires coordination across multiple functional units but does not warrant a full-time project manager with dedicated authority.

### 4. Projectized (Pure Product) Organization
In a projectized structure, teams operate as separate units under the leadership of a full-time project manager who has complete line authority over the project. Functional departments, if they exist, primarily provide support services to these project teams. This structure is common when projects are the dominant form of business.
-   Advantages:
    -   The project manager has complete line authority and strong control.
    -   Team members work directly for the project manager, fostering loyalty and clear accountability.
    -   Unprofitable product lines (projects) can be easily identified and addressed.
    -   Strong communication channels within the project team.
    -   Staff can maintain expertise on a specific project without being shared.
    -   Very rapid reaction time to project needs and changes.
    -   Strong project identification can lead to better morale.
    -   A clear focal point for out-of-company customer relations.
    -   Flexibility in making time, cost, and performance trade-offs.
    -   Easier interface management due to smaller, focused units.
    -   Upper-level management has more free time for executive decision-making.
-   Disadvantages:
    -   Can be cost-prohibitive in multiproduct companies due to duplication of effort, facilities, and personnel, leading to inefficient resource usage.
    -   A tendency to retain personnel on a project longer than necessary; upper management must manage workloads as projects start and end.
    -   Technological development may suffer without strong central functional groups to foster expertise and innovation for future programs.
    -   Control of functional specialists requires top-level coordination.
    -   Lack of opportunities for technical interchange between different projects.
    -   Potential lack of career continuity and opportunities for project personnel once a project ends.

### 5. Matrix Organization
A matrix structure is a hybrid that overlays a project-based structure onto a traditional functional hierarchy. Employees report to both a functional manager (vertically) and one or more project managers (horizontally). This structure aims to optimize resource use and integrate diverse expertise.
-   Advantages:
    -   The project manager can maintain significant project control over resources, including cost and personnel, often through negotiation with line managers.
    -   Project-specific policies and procedures can be established, provided they align with company policies.
    -   The project manager may have the authority to commit company resources, contingent on avoiding conflicts with other projects.
    -   Allows for rapid responses to changes, conflict resolution, and project needs.
    -   Functional organizations primarily support projects.
    -   Employees have a "home" department to return to after project completion, potentially offering career paths and stability.
    -   Key personnel can be shared across projects, minimizing program costs.
    -   A strong technical base can be developed, with knowledge available equally to all projects.
    -   Conflicts, when managed well, can lead to better solutions; hierarchical referrals are often more easily resolved.
    -   Better balance among time, cost, and performance.
    -   Facilitates the rapid development of both specialists and generalists.
    -   Shared authority and responsibility.
    -   Stress can be distributed among the team and functional managers.
-   Disadvantages:
    -   Multidimensional information and workflow can be complex.
    -   Dual reporting relationships can create confusion and conflicting priorities.
    -   Continuously changing priorities can be disruptive.
    -   Management goals may differ from project goals, leading to potential conflicts.
    -   High potential for continuous conflict and the need for resolution mechanisms.
    -   Difficulty in monitoring and control due to the complex structure.
    -   May not be cost-effective company-wide if it requires more administrative personnel.
    -   Each project organization might operate independently, risking duplication of effort.
    -   Requires more initial effort and time to define policies and procedures compared to traditional forms.
    -   Functional managers may be biased by their own departmental priorities.
    -   The balance of power between functional and project managers needs careful management.
    -   The balance of time, cost, and performance must be diligently monitored.
    -   Reaction time can become slow for overall organizational issues despite rapid response for individual problems.
    -   Employees and managers are more susceptible to role ambiguity.
    -   Individuals may feel they lack control over their destiny due to reporting to multiple managers.

Different Forms of Matrix:
-   Weak Matrix: The functional (line) manager has more influence than the project manager. The project manager often acts more as a coordinator or expeditor.
-   Strong Matrix: The project manager has more influence and authority than the functional manager. Project managers may have full-time staff and significant control over resources.
-   Balanced Matrix: The project manager and functional manager share authority. The project manager typically sets the overall plan and objectives, while the functional manager determines how the work is done and assigns personnel.

## Selecting an Organizational Form

The choice of an organizational form is critical and depends on various factors. Project management is most effective for undertakings that are:
-   Definable with a specific goal.
-   Infrequent, unique, or unfamiliar to the existing organization.
    -   Complex in terms of task interdependencies.
-   Critical to the company's success.

Key factors influencing the selection include:
1.  Project size: Larger projects might necessitate more formal projectized or strong matrix structures.
2.  Project length: Short-term projects might use weaker matrix forms, while long-term projects could justify dedicated teams.
3.  Experience with project management: Organizations new to project management might start with simpler forms.
4.  Philosophy and visibility of upper-level management: Their support and understanding of project management are crucial.
5.  Project location: Geographically dispersed projects might require different structures than co-located ones.
6.  Available resources: Resource constraints can dictate the feasibility of certain structures (e.g., projectized forms require dedicated resources).
7.  Unique aspects of the project: High-tech or strategically critical projects may warrant specialized structures.

Three tasks to be considered for varied organizational nature are control, integration, and external relationships.

## Roles and Responsibilities of Stakeholders in a Project

### 1. Project Manager/Leader
The project manager is primarily responsible for the successful completion of a project. Their role involves ensuring the project meets its objectives within the defined scope, time, and budget. They manage interactions with all contributors and stakeholders and ensure adequate resource allocation.
Key responsibilities include:
-   Developing the project plan, including scope, objectives, deliverables, and timelines.
-   Managing project outputs in line with the plan.
-   Identifying and acquiring project personnel and resources.
-   Leading and managing the project team, fostering collaboration and motivation.
-   Establishing the project's methodology and processes.
-   Organizing the project schedule and detailing each step or activity.
-   Distributing tasks among project team members.
-   Communicating with senior management and other stakeholders, providing regular updates and reports.
-   Monitoring and controlling project progress, managing risks and issues.
-   Ensuring quality standards are met.
-   Managing the project budget and controlling costs.
-   Closing the project upon completion, including documentation and lessons learned.

Effective project management relies on strong leadership. A project leader works to keep the team engaged, motivated, and focused. They are receptive to team members' feelings and can effectively make plans supporting project goals. A successful project manager/leader inspires their team, encourages creativity, and fosters a collaborative work environment.

Specific responsibilities of a project leader may include:
-   Working with departmental heads and stakeholders to develop team goals and delegate tasks.
-   Developing team schedules and assisting in onboarding and training.
-   Communicating clear expectations and goals.
-   Offering emotional support and making team members feel valued.
-   Maintaining frequent communication for encouragement, task amendments, and progress updates.
-   Implementing incentives for motivation.
-   Providing feedback on performance, addressing weaknesses, and supporting skill improvement.
-   Nurturing collaboration and creativity.
-   Quickly resolving team conflicts.
-   Writing project reports and rewarding team efforts.

Key skills for a project leader:
-   Team Management: Establishing a skilled team, encouraging collaboration, setting goals, and conducting performance reviews.
-   Communication: Effectively conveying ideas and directing the team.
-   Listening: Actively understanding team members' concerns and feedback.
-   Conflict Resolution: Recognizing and de-escalating tensions or disputes.
-   Team Leadership: Working without bias, combining conflict resolution, team management, and communication to guide the team.
-   Organization: Managing deadlines, delegating tasks, and creating effective schedules.
-   Critical Thinking: Finding creative solutions, anticipating roadblocks, and overcoming obstacles.
-   Time Management: Ensuring tasks are completed efficiently and deadlines are met.

The Project Leadership Matrix considers proactive/reactive approaches and task/people focus:
-   Quadrant I: Reactive People Leadership (Focus on immediate people issues, inspiring/engaging reactively)
-   Quadrant II: Reactive Task Management (Focus on immediate task issues, authority-based, reactive)
-   Quadrant III: Proactive Task Management (Focus on project's strategic vision for tasks, authority-based, proactive)
-   Quadrant IV: Proactive People Leadership (Focus on project's strategic vision for people, inspiring/engaging proactively)

Managers tend to focus on goals, telling how/when, shorter range, structure, autocracy, maintaining, conforming, administrating, controlling, procedures, consistency, risk-avoidance, and the bottom line. Leadership focuses on vision, selling what/why, longer range, people, democracy, enabling, developing, challenging, originating, innovating, inspiring trust, policy, flexibility, risk-opportunity, and the top line. Good managers do things right; good leadership does the right thing.

7 Keys to Project Leadership: Be Authentic, Lead with Vision, Improve and Innovate, Empower the Team, Get close to Stakeholders, Establish a solid foundation, Work with Intent.

The project manager's role is evolving to encompass not just technical drivers (initiating, planning, executing, monitoring & controlling, closing) but also leadership and business drivers (communicating, leading, managing, effectiveness, professionalism, correlating project value to business goals, gaining commitment, tying project to strategy).

Expectations of top management from project managers:
-   Assume total accountability.
-   Provide effective reports and information.
-   Minimize organizational disruption.
-   Present recommendations, not just alternatives.
-   Handle most interpersonal problems.
-   Demonstrate self-starting capacity and growth.

Project management expects top management to:
-   Provide clearly defined decision channels and take actions on requests.
-   Facilitate interfacing with support departments and assist in conflict resolution.
-   Provide sufficient resources, charter, strategic information, and feedback.
-   Define expectations clearly and offer protection from political infighting.
-   Provide opportunities for growth.

### 2. Project Team Member
Project team members are individuals who actively participate in one or more phases of the project. They can be internal employees or external consultants, working full-time or part-time. Their roles vary based on project needs and their expertise.
Typical responsibilities include:
-   Contributing to the achievement of overall project goals.
-   Completing assigned individual tasks and deliverables.
-   Providing specialized knowledge and expertise.
-   Collaborating with users and other stakeholders to define and meet business requirements.
-   Documenting processes and work performed.

### 3. Project Sponsor
The project sponsor is typically a senior manager who acts as the project's champion and advocate within the organization. They have a vested interest in the project's success and provide high-level guidance and support.
Key responsibilities include:
-   Making key strategic decisions for the project.
-   Approving the project budget and ensuring resource availability.
-   Championing the project and communicating its objectives throughout the organization.
-   Providing approvals for phase progression and major changes.
-   Assisting in resolving high-level conflicts and removing roadblocks.

### 4. Project Stakeholders
Project stakeholders are any individuals, groups, or organizations that may affect, be affected by, or perceive themselves to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project. Their satisfaction is often critical to project success.
-   Internal stakeholders: Directly involved from within the organization (e.g., project team, manager, sponsor, other internal departments).
-   External stakeholders: Affected by the project's outcome but not directly involved in its execution (e.g., clients, end-users, customers, subcontractors, government, suppliers, the community).
Typical responsibilities include:
-   Identifying project constraints and requirements.
-   Highlighting potential project risks.
-   Offering expertise and specialized knowledge.
-   Providing feedback on project deliverables and progress.

### 5. Business Analyst
The business analyst plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between business needs and project solutions. They identify business requirements, propose improvements, and ensure that project outcomes deliver value.
Key responsibilities include:
-   Assisting in defining the project scope and objectives.
-   Eliciting and documenting requirements from users and business units.
-   Ensuring project deliverables meet the specified requirements.
-   Validating solutions and participating in testing to confirm goals are met.

## Relationship Between Project Manager and Line Manager

The project manager's role involves controlling company resources—money, manpower, equipment, facilities, materials, and information/technology—within the constraints of time, cost, and performance, all while maintaining good customer relations. However, project managers typically do not control these resources directly, except perhaps the project budget. Resources are generally controlled by line managers (functional managers or resource managers).

Therefore, project managers must negotiate with line managers for all project resources. When project managers "control" resources, it usually means they manage resources temporarily loaned to them via the line managers. Successful project management heavily depends on:
1.  A good daily working relationship between the project manager and line managers who assign resources.
2.  The ability of functional employees to report vertically to their line manager while also reporting horizontally to one or more project managers.

Functional employees assigned to a project still receive technical direction from their line managers. Since line managers often control performance reviews and salary (their "purse strings"), employees may favor them, putting project managers in a position where they need strong negotiation and interpersonal skills. Classical management involves accomplishing objectives through others; in project management, the project manager often works to facilitate the line managers' effective use of resources, acting as an agent for achieving project goals.

Conflicts can arise over who contributes to profits. Project managers might feel they control profits via the budget, while line managers argue their role in staffing, resource provision, and performance supervision is key. Both contribute to profits, and such conflicts can damage the project management system.

An illustrative example highlights the give-and-take relationship: A project manager might need a line manager to reduce man-hours on a task to save costs, and the line manager agrees, creating an "IOU." Later, the line manager might ask the project manager to take on staff earlier than needed for a new project to secure their availability, calling in the "IOU." This demonstrates that project management is highly behavioral, requiring understanding of quantitative tools, organizational structures, and organizational behavior. Project managers must understand line operations and their own authority limits.

# Leadership and Team Management

## Leadership Styles for Project Managers

Leadership is the ability to influence a group toward the achievement of a vision or set of goals. Management involves coping with complexity, while leadership involves coping with change.

1.  Situational Leadership:
    This style emphasizes adapting the leadership approach based on the situation and the maturity level (readiness) of the followers.
    -   Leadership Approaches (Hersey & Blanchard):
        -   S1: Telling/Directing: High task, low relationship. Leaders provide specific instructions and closely supervise performance. Best for followers who are unable and unwilling or insecure (M1 maturity).
        -   S2: Selling/Coaching: High task, high relationship. Leaders explain decisions and provide opportunities for clarification, supporting and encouraging followers. Best for followers who are unable but willing or confident (M2 maturity).
        -   S3: Participating/Supporting: Low task, high relationship. Leaders share ideas and facilitate in decision making, focusing on relationships and follower development. Best for followers who are able but unwilling or insecure (M3 maturity).
        -   S4: Delegating: Low task, low relationship. Leaders turn over responsibility for decisions and implementation to followers. Best for followers who are able and willing or confident (M4 maturity).
    -   Maturity Levels of Followers:
        -   M1: Low competence, low commitment/confidence.
        -   M2: Low to some competence, high commitment/variable confidence.
        -   M3: Moderate to high competence, variable commitment/lack of confidence.
        -   M4: High competence, high commitment/confidence.
    A mismatch between leadership style and follower maturity can lead to negative outcomes, such as damaging relationships or failing to develop team members.

2.  Visionary Leadership:
    Articulates a clear, inspiring vision of where the group is going, motivating people by helping them see how their work fits into the bigger picture. The underlying message is "Come with me." This style fosters innovation and risk-taking.
    -   When it works: When changes require a new vision or clear direction.
    -   When it doesn't work: With a team of experts who may see the leader as out of touch or pompous.

3.  Coaching Leadership:
    Focuses on developing people for the future. Helps individuals identify strengths and weaknesses and links them to personal and career aspirations. Tolerates short-term failures. The message is "Try this" or "I believe in you."
    -   When it works: To help individuals improve performance and build long-term capabilities, especially with motivated individuals.
    -   When it doesn't work: If followers lack motivation or require strong direction, or if the leader lacks coaching expertise.

4.  Affiliative Leadership:
    Emphasizes creating emotional bonds and harmony within the team. Values people and their feelings over tasks and goals. The message is "People come first."
    -   When it works: To heal rifts in a team, increase morale, improve communication, or repair broken trust. Often used with visionary style.
    -   When it doesn't work: If used alone, as poor performance may go uncorrected. Not ideal in crises or when clear direction is needed.

5.  Democratic Leadership:
    Builds consensus through participation. Listens actively to employee concerns and involves them in decision-making. The message is "What do you think?"
    -   When it works: To build buy-in or consensus, or when the leader needs ideas from informed followers.
    -   When it doesn't work: In crises requiring quick decisions or if employees are uninformed or incompetent.

6.  Pacesetting Leadership:
    Sets high standards for performance and expects excellence, often exemplifying it personally. Can be demanding and quick to criticize poor performance. The message is "Do as I do, now."
    -   When it works: To get high-quality results from a motivated and competent team needing little direction.
    -   When it doesn't work: If used alone or overplayed, it can overwhelm team members and stifle innovation. Not effective if the team needs support.

7.  Commanding (Coercive) Leadership:
    Demands immediate compliance. Seeks tight control and monitors situations closely. Feedback focuses on wrongdoing. The message is "Do what I tell you."
    -   When it works: In a crisis, to kick-start a turnaround, or with problem employees.
    -   When it doesn't work: As a sustainable dominant style, as it can erode morale and initiative.

8.  Transformational Leadership:
    Inspires followers to exceed their own self-interests for the good of the organization. Leaders are energetic, enthusiastic, and passionate, encouraging innovation and change.

9.  Ethical Leadership:
    Demonstrates normatively appropriate conduct through personal actions and interpersonal relationships. Promotes such conduct to followers through two-way communication, reinforcement, and decision-making. Key aspects include showing justice, building community, respecting others, serving others, and manifesting honesty. It encompasses Corporate Social Responsibility, work-life balance, the psychological contract, Fair Trade principles, and a "4 P" approach (Purpose, Planet, People, Principles).

## Conflict Resolution

Conflict is a process that begins when one party perceives that another party has negatively affected, or is about to negatively affect, something that the first party cares about. It can manifest as collision, disagreement, clash, fight, controversy, or discord.

Conflict Resolution Approaches:
-   What Doesn't Work: Yelling, refusing to change or compromise, name-calling, hitting, walking out, belittling.
-   What Does Work: Negotiation, mediation, looking at both sides, aiming for a win-win attitude.

Conflict can be positive when resolved constructively using win-win problem-solving, which can strengthen relationships.

Win-Win Solution Process:
1.  Identify Who Owns the Problem: The person negatively affected by the problem is responsible for finding a resolution, even if they didn't cause it. Avoid fight, flight, or obedience responses.
2.  Preparation for Resolving:
    -   Include only those concerned.
    -   Describe the problem respectfully to all involved.
    -   Explain the win-win process and agree not to revert to win-lose methods.
    -   Find a suitable time and place without distractions.
3.  Identify the Problem or Issues:
    -   Use "I" messages to explain personal concerns, needs, and goals.
    -   Use reflective listening to acknowledge the other's needs and goals.
    -   List everyone's actual needs related to the problem.
4.  Brainstorm All Possible Solutions:
    -   Generate all conceivable ways to solve the problem so everyone's needs are met.
    -   Defer evaluation and criticism during brainstorming. Record all ideas.
    -   Consider exercises like "cake cutting" (dividing a resource fairly) or "car sharing" (finding solutions for shared, limited resources) to stimulate creative thinking. Recognize that perception influences understanding (illustrated by optical illusions).
5.  Evaluate the Alternative Solutions:
    -   Assess if each solution will work, meet all needs, and if any problems are likely.
    -   Don't accept solutions hastily. Use reflective listening and "I" messages.
6.  Decide on the Best Solution:
    -   Find a mutually acceptable solution.
    -   If agreement is difficult, summarize areas of agreement, restate needs, and seek new solutions.
    -   Ensure commitment from all parties to the chosen solution.
7.  Implement the Solutions:
    -   Agree on who does what by when. Document this agreement.
    -   Avoid policing the solution; allow for ownership.
    -   If desired, set criteria for success upfront.

## Team Management

Team management involves guiding a group of individuals to work together effectively towards a common goal.
-   Essential Elements of a Team: Small size, complementary skills, common purpose and performance goals, a common approach, and mutual accountability.
-   Avoiding Sabotage of Teamwork: Leaders should avoid constantly "saving the day" (which might indicate lack of training or information sharing for the team) and ensure they are not withholding information or failing to delegate.
-   Delegation: Strong leaders delegate to free themselves for significant tasks and to develop subordinates' skills.
-   Good Leader Practices: Take risks, show concern (recognize good work, make work fun), don't make excuses, support teamwork and decisions, and pursue continued development.
-   What Employees Want: Recognition ("pat on the back"), to be listened to, autonomy (stop hounding), opportunities for suggestions, positive interactions (smile), empathy, respect, clear communication (stop yelling/talking down), training, and challenges.

## Diversity Management

Diversity management aims to create and maintain a positive work environment where the similarities and differences of individuals are valued.
-   Understanding Diversity: Diversity is the mosaic of people bringing varied backgrounds, styles, perspectives, values, and beliefs as assets.
-   Distinction:
    -   Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO): Enforcement of statutes to prevent employment discrimination.
    -   Affirmative Action: Efforts to achieve parity in the workforce through outreach and eliminating hiring barriers.
    -   Diversity & Inclusion: Leveraging workforce differences to achieve better results and fostering an environment where everyone feels valued and can contribute fully.
-   Dimensions of Diversity:
    -   Primary: Age, gender, ethnic heritage, race, disability, sexual orientation (generally core, unchangeable).
    -   Secondary: Geographic location, military experience, education, work experience, socioeconomic status, work/thinking style, family status, religion, communication style, first language, organizational role/level (generally more mutable).
-   Communication and Culture: All communication is filtered through an individual's cultural perspective, which is shaped by numerous diversity dimensions.
-   Benefits of Workforce Diversity & Inclusion: Improved understanding of stakeholders, an environment allowing full potential, multiple perspectives for problem-solving, better performance outcomes, increased productivity and retention, boosted morale, improved customer relations, reduced complaints.

## Change Management

Change management is the process, tools, and techniques to manage the people side of change to achieve the required business outcome. It recognizes that there is always scope for improvement, refinement, and adding features.
-   5 Steps in the Change Management Process:
    1.  Prepare the Organization for Change: Assess readiness and build awareness.
    2.  Craft a Vision and Plan for Change: Define the future state and how to get there.
    3.  Implement the Changes: Execute the plan.
    4.  Embed Changes Within Company Culture and Practices: Reinforce new behaviors and processes.
    5.  Review Progress and Analyze Results: Monitor, evaluate, and adjust.
-   Change Management Components:
    -   Leadership Alignment: Ensure leaders and sponsors are engaged and supportive.
    -   Stakeholder Engagement: Identify key stakeholders, understand their influence, and devise engagement plans.
    -   Communication: Shape the vision, build awareness and understanding, and establish feedback loops.
    -   Change Impact and Readiness: Assess stakeholder readiness and the scale of impact for each group.
    -   Organizational Design: Define new organizational designs, structures, processes, and role changes.
    -   Training: Assess learning needs and build capabilities to support the change.

# Project Scheduling

Project scheduling is the process of defining project activities, sequencing them, estimating their duration, and developing a schedule for project completion.

## Introduction to PERT and CPM
-   Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT): Developed for the Polaris missile project, where many tasks involved uncertain durations due to scientific and engineering challenges (probabilistic task durations).
-   Critical Path Method (CPM): Developed for coordinating maintenance projects in the chemical industry. Tasks were routine, but the overall project was complex (deterministic task durations).

Both PERT and CPM:
-   Graphically display activity precedence and sequence.
-   Estimate the project's total duration.
-   Identify critical activities that, if delayed, will delay the entire project.
-   Estimate slack (float) for non-critical activities.

Learning Objectives for Scheduling:
-   Diagramming project activity networks.
-   Estimating project completion time.
-   Computing probability of completion by a specific time (PERT).
-   Determining how to reduce project length effectively (crashing).
-   Understanding critical chain approach.

## Network Diagrams
-   Activity-on-Node (AON): Nodes represent activities, and arrows show precedence relationships.
    -   Example a: A → B → C (A precedes B, B precedes C).
    -   Example b: A must be completed before B and C can begin.
    -   Example c: A and B must both be completed before C or D can begin.
    -   Example d: B and C can begin after A is completed; D cannot begin until both B and C are completed.

Illustrative Project Example (Finolex Cables - 11 activities):
Activity A (Develop specs, 4wks, No Predecessor)
Activity B (Design process, 6wks, Pred: A)
Activity C (Source materials, 3wks, Pred: A)
Activity D (Source tooling, 6wks, Pred: B)
Activity E (Install tooling, 14wks, Pred: D)
Activity F (Receive materials, 5wks, Pred: C)
Activity G (Pilot run, 2wks, Pred: E, F)
Activity H (Eval product design, 2wks, Pred: G)
Activity I (Eval process perf., 3wks, Pred: G)
Activity J (Write report, 4wks, Pred: H, I)
Activity K (Transition to mfg., 2wks, Pred: J)

AON Diagram for Finolex Cables:
-   A is the start.
-   B and C follow A.
-   D follows B.
-   E follows D.
-   F follows C.
-   G follows E and F.
-   H and I follow G.
-   J follows H and I.
-   K follows J and is the end.

## Time Estimation and Critical Path
1.  Identify Connected Paths:
    -   Path 1: A-B-D-E-G-H-J-K
    -   Path 2: A-B-D-E-G-I-J-K
    -   Path 3: A-C-F-G-H-J-K
    -   Path 4: A-C-F-G-I-J-K
2.  Calculate Path Durations (using deterministic times from example):
    -   Path 1: 4+6+6+14+2+2+4+2 = 40 weeks
    -   Path 2: 4+6+6+14+2+3+4+2 = 41 weeks
    -   Path 3: 4+3+5+2+2+4+2 = 22 weeks
    -   Path 4: 4+3+5+2+3+4+2 = 23 weeks
3.  Determine Critical Path: The longest path determines the project's minimum duration. Here, Path 2 (A-B-D-E-G-I-J-K) is 41 weeks, making it the critical path.

Network Definitions:
-   Critical Path: The sequence of activities that determines the earliest project completion time. Activities on this path have zero slack.
-   Slack (or Float): The amount of time a non-critical activity can be delayed without delaying the project's completion. Slack = Late Finish (LF) - Early Finish (EF) or Late Start (LS) - Early Start (ES).
-   Earliest Start (ES): The earliest time an activity can begin, based on the earliest finish of preceding activities.
-   Earliest Finish (EF): ES + activity duration.
-   Latest Start (LS): The latest time an activity can begin without delaying project completion. LS = LF - activity duration.
-   Latest Finish (LF): The latest time an activity can finish without delaying project completion. Determined by working backward from the project end date.

Forward Pass (Calculating ES and EF):
-   Start with ES=0 for the first activity.
-   For subsequent activities, ES is the maximum EF of all immediate predecessors.
-   EF = ES + duration.
(Example calculations for Finolex: A: ES=0, EF=4. B: ES=4, EF=10. C: ES=4, EF=7. D: ES=10, EF=16. E: ES=16, EF=30. F: ES=7, EF=12. G: ES=max(EF of E, EF of F)=max(30,12)=30, EF=32. H: ES=32, EF=34. I: ES=32, EF=35. J: ES=max(EF of H, EF of I)=max(34,35)=35, EF=39. K: ES=39, EF=41. Project duration = 41 weeks.)

Backward Pass (Calculating LS and LF):
-   Start with LF = EF of the last activity (or a target completion date).
-   LS = LF - duration.
-   For preceding activities, LF is the minimum LS of all immediate successors.
(Example calculations for Finolex, assuming project completes at EF=41: K: LF=41, LS=39. J: LF=39, LS=35. I: LF=35, LS=32. H: LF=35, LS=33. G: LF=min(LS of I, LS of H)=min(32,33)=32, LS=30. And so on.)

Calculating Slack for Finolex Example:
-   A: LF=4, EF=4, Slack=0 (Critical)
-   B: LF=10, EF=10, Slack=0 (Critical)
-   C: LF=25, EF=7, Slack=18
-   D: LF=16, EF=16, Slack=0 (Critical)
-   E: LF=30, EF=30, Slack=0 (Critical)
-   F: LF=30, EF=12, Slack=18
-   G: LF=32, EF=32, Slack=0 (Critical)
-   H: LF=35, EF=34, Slack=1
-   I: LF=35, EF=35, Slack=0 (Critical)
-   J: LF=39, EF=39, Slack=0 (Critical)
-   K: LF=41, EF=41, Slack=0 (Critical)
Critical path: A-B-D-E-G-I-J-K.

## Probabilistic Time Estimates (PERT)
PERT uses three time estimates for each activity to account for uncertainty:
-   Optimistic time (a): The minimum possible time if everything goes perfectly.
-   Most likely time (m): The best estimate of the time required.
-   Pessimistic time (b): The maximum possible time if significant delays occur.

Expected Time (ET) for an activity is calculated using the beta distribution:
ET = (a + 4m + b) / 6

Variance (σ²) for an activity:
σ² = [(b - a) / 6]²

Standard Deviation (σ) for an activity:
σ = (b - a) / 6

The project's expected completion time is the sum of ETs along the critical path. The project variance is the sum of variances of activities on the critical path. This allows for calculating the probability of completing the project by a certain date using normal distribution assumptions.

## Resource Considerations in Projects
Resources include people, time, tools, and capital.
-   Resource Allocation: The process of assigning and managing assets to support strategic goals.
-   Resource Availability/Limits: Factors like due dates, late penalties, early completion incentives, and budget constraints.
-   Activity Information Needed:
    -   Identification of all required activities.
    -   Estimation of resources (e.g., time, personnel) for each activity.
    -   Immediate predecessors for establishing interrelationships.

## Project Cost Estimation and Budgets
Project cost estimation and budget management are challenging. The goal is to identify all costs associated with the project to create an accurate budget and timeline. The project budget is built from the cost estimate and the schedule.

Types of Costs:
-   Direct Costs: Clearly chargeable to a specific work package (e.g., labor, materials, equipment).
-   Indirect Costs:
    -   Overhead: Costs not directly tied to a specific project but necessary for operations (e.g., rent, utilities).
    -   General & Administrative (G&A) Costs: Costs associated with running the business (e.g., executive salaries, employee benefits not directly charged to projects).

Project Cost Estimation Methods:
-   Top-Down (Analogous Estimating): Uses historical data from similar past projects. Useful when projects are repetitive. Less accurate but quicker.
-   Bottom-Up Estimating: Breaks the project into smaller parts (e.g., Work Breakdown Structure - WBS elements), estimates costs for each part, and then aggregates them. More accurate but time-consuming.

Project Cost Estimation Tools:
-   Earned Value Management (EVM): A methodology that integrates scope, schedule, and resource measurements to assess project performance and progress.
    -   Planned Value (PV): The authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. (Sum of all planned budgets = Budget at Completion, BAC).
    -   Earned Value (EV): The measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized for that work. EV = % work complete × BAC.
    -   Actual Cost (AC): The realized cost incurred for the work performed.
    -   Schedule Variance (SV) = EV - PV (Positive is good)
    -   Cost Variance (CV) = EV - AC (Positive is good)
    -   Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = EV / PV (Greater than 1 is good)
    -   Cost Performance Index (CPI) = EV / AC (Greater than 1 is good)
    -   Estimate at Completion (EAC): The expected total cost of completing all work. Common formulas:
        -   EAC = BAC / CPI (if current variances are typical of future)
        -   EAC = AC + (BAC - EV) (if future work will be done at planned rate)
        -   EAC = AC + (BAC - EV) / (SPI × CPI) (if both cost and schedule performance will impact future)
    -   Estimate to Complete (ETC) = EAC - AC
    -   Variance at Completion (VAC) = BAC - EAC

-   To Complete Performance Index (TCPI): A measure of the cost performance required with the remaining resources to meet a specified management financial goal.
    -   Formula: TCPI = Work Remaining / Funds Remaining
        -   If aiming for BAC: TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)
        -   If aiming for EAC: TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)
    -   If TCPI > 1, future work must be done more efficiently than planned. If TCPI < 1, some inefficiency can be tolerated.

Example of TCPI calculation:
Project duration 24 months, BAC = $200,000.
After 12 months: AC = $110,000, 60% work complete.
EV = 60% of $200,000 = $120,000.
CPI = EV / AC = $120,000 / $110,000 = 1.09 (approximately 1.1 in PPT example).
Since CPI > 1 (under budget), use TCPI based on BAC:
TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC) = ($200,000 - $120,000) / ($200,000 - $110,000)
TCPI = $80,000 / $90,000 = 0.89.
This means the project can continue with a CPI of 0.89 for the remaining work and still meet the BAC.

Case Study Example (Indira Gandhi International Delhi Airport): Illustrates project cost break-up, sources of finance, and how increases in project cost estimates are financed, highlighting issues like design-build approach impacts, risk mitigation, and EPC contract terms.

# Project Risk Management

## Introduction to Risk and Risk Management
-   Risk: A potential problem; an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives such as scope, schedule, cost, and quality. It's a measure of the probability and consequence of not achieving a defined project goal.
    -   Conceptual definition: Risk concerns future happenings, involves change (in mind, opinions, actions, places), and involves choice and the uncertainty that choice entails.
    -   Uncertainty: The risk may or may not happen. Risks are not 100% certain (those are constraints).
    -   Loss: If the risk materializes, unwanted consequences or losses occur.
-   Project Risk Management: The process of identifying, analyzing, responding to, and monitoring project risks. It aims to increase the likelihood and impact of positive events and decrease the likelihood and impact of negative events.
-   Role in Overall Project Management: Integral to achieving project objectives. Risks can arise from the inability to meet functional requirements and business expectations throughout the project life cycle.
-   Risk Components:
    -   Probability (Likelihood) of occurrence.
    -   Impact (Consequence) of the event occurring.
    -   Risk = f(likelihood, impact)
-   Perspective: Unfavorable future events are risks; favorable future events are opportunities.
-   Cause: Hazards. Overcome by knowing them and taking action. Risk = f(Hazards, Safeguard).

## Risk Categories
Risks can be broadly grouped into:
-   Operational Risks
-   Financial Risks
-   People (HR) Risks
-   Strategic Risks

Other categorizations include:
-   Technological Risks: Design risk, manufacturing risk, quality risk, reliability risk, safety risk.
-   Business Risks: Market risk, strategic risk, sales risk, management risk, budget risk.
-   Societal Risks: Environmental hazards, economic factors.
-   National Risks: National economic well-being, military factors.

Further classification:
-   Known Risks: Risks that can be uncovered after careful evaluation of the project plan, business/technical environment, and other reliable information sources (e.g., unrealistic delivery date).
-   Predictable Risks: Risks extrapolated from past project experiences (e.g., staff turnover based on past rates).
-   Unpredictable Risks: Risks that can and do occur but are extremely difficult to identify in advance (e.g., sudden major regulatory change).

## Steps in Risk Management
1.  Risk Identification: Determining which risks might affect the project and documenting their characteristics.
2.  Risk Analysis:
    -   Qualitative Risk Analysis: Prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact.
    -   Quantitative Risk Analysis: Numerically analyzing the effect of identified risks on overall project objectives.
3.  Risk Response Planning: Developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to project objectives. Strategies include:
    -   For Negative Risks (Threats): Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, Accept.
    -   For Positive Risks (Opportunities): Exploit, Share, Enhance, Accept.
4.  Risk Monitoring and Control: Tracking identified risks, monitoring residual risks, identifying new risks, executing risk response plans, and evaluating their effectiveness throughout the project life cycle.

Reducing Risks involves implementing the chosen risk response strategies.

# Project Financial Management

# Product Development and Entrepreneurship

## Product Development
Product development is the complete process of bringing a new product to market, or improving an existing one.

Product Development Process:
-   Generic Process: Planning → Concept Development → System-Level Design → Detail Design → Testing and Refinement → Production Ramp-Up → Project Review.
-   Spiral Process: Involves iterative cycles of Design → Build → Test within the development stages.
-   Complex System Process: May involve multiple design and test iterations at subsystem levels before integration.

Product Development Organizations:
Different organizational structures can be used (Functional, Project, Lightweight Matrix, Heavyweight Matrix), each affecting how product development teams are managed.

Stages in Product Development:
1.  Product Planning: Identifying opportunities, evaluating and prioritizing projects, allocating resources, and creating mission statements for selected projects.
2.  Identifying Customer Needs: Gathering customer input (e.g., through interviews, surveys, observation) to understand their requirements and desires. This activity is central to concept development.
3.  Product Specifications: Translating customer needs into precise, measurable technical specifications.
4.  Concept Generation: Developing a range of product concepts that could meet the identified needs and specifications.
5.  Concept Selection: Evaluating and choosing the most promising concept(s) based on criteria like technical feasibility, market potential, and alignment with business goals.
6.  Concept Testing: Presenting the selected concept(s) to potential customers to gauge their reaction and refine the idea.
7.  Design for Manufacturing (DFM): Designing products in a way that makes them easy and cost-effective to manufacture, while maintaining quality. The DFM method involves estimating manufacturing costs, identifying areas for cost reduction (components, assembly, support), considering impacts on other factors, and iterating until an acceptable design is achieved. DFM aims to reduce manufacturing costs and improve product quality, development time, and cost.
8.  Prototyping: Creating preliminary versions of the product (from simple mock-ups to functional prototypes) for testing, evaluation, and refinement.
9.  Robust Design: Designing products and processes to perform consistently and reliably despite variations (noise) in manufacturing, environment, or usage. The seven-step process for robust design:
    1.  Identify control factors, noise factors, and performance metrics.
    2.  Formulate an objective function.
    3.  Develop the experimental plan (e.g., using Design of Experiments).
    4.  Run the experiment.
    5.  Conduct the analysis.
    6.  Select and confirm factor set points.
    7.  Reflect and repeat if necessary.

## Entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurship is the process of designing, launching, and running a new business, which is often initially a small business.
-   Concept, Knowledge, and Skills Requirement: Involves innovation, risk-taking, and business acumen.
-   Characteristics of Successful Entrepreneurs: Initiative, voluntarism, risk management and responsibility, creativity and innovation, passion to win, ability to provide effective consumer solutions, focus on long-term profitability, contributing to economic growth.
-   Entrepreneurship Process:
    1.  Identifying an opportunity.
    2.  Assessing and acquiring necessary resources (financial, human, technical).
    3.  Execution: Producing the product/service, marketing, designing and building the company, responding to the environment.
-   Factors Impacting Emergence of Entrepreneurship:
    -   Personal Attributes: High internal locus of control, desire for financial success, desire for self-realization, joy of innovation, risk tolerance.
    -   Environmental Factors: Local/regional/national attitudes towards entrepreneurship, social/cultural pressures, access to role models, family/community responsibilities, government support and facilities.

## Legal Issues Related to Product Development and Entrepreneurship

1.  Intellectual Property Rights (IPR):
    -   Patents: Exclusive rights granted for an invention, allowing the patent holder to exclude others from making, using, or selling the invention for a limited period. Requirements typically include utility, novelty, and non-obviousness. India's laws align with TRIPS agreement.
    -   Trademarks: A unique mark (e.g., name, logo, symbol) that identifies and distinguishes the goods or services of one company from those of others. Provides exclusive rights to use, license, or sell the mark. Protected for a limited period (e.g., 10 years in India) and renewable. Examples: Google logo, Head & Shoulders logo.
    -   Copyrights: Legal rights granted to the creator of original works of authorship, including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works (e.g., books, films, music, software code, databases). Protects the expression of an idea, not the idea itself. Symbols: TM (unregistered trademark), ® (registered trademark), SM (service mark), © (copyright for non-audio), ℗ (copyright for audio).
    -   Trade Secrets: Confidential business information that provides a competitive edge (e.g., formulas, practices, designs, instruments, or a compilation of information). Protected by keeping them secret. Examples: Coca-Cola formula, KFC recipe, Google search algorithm.

2.  Licensing: An agreement where the owner of IPR (licensor) grants another party (licensee) the right to use that IPR in exchange for royalties or fees. Ownership of the ultimate product made under license is with the licensee. Common for products and goods (e.g., Calvin Klein perfumes).
    -   Pros for Licensee: Access to market with a strong brand without heavy capital investment.
    -   Cons for Licensor: Less control over the ultimate use of its IPR.

3.  Franchising: A method of distributing products or services involving a franchisor, who establishes the brand's trademark or trade name and a business system, and a franchisee, who pays a royalty and often an initial fee for the right to do business under the franchisor's name and system. More common in service industries. Ownership of the individual business unit is with the franchisee.
    -   Pros: Franchisor expands geographically with less capital; franchisee gets a proven business model and support.
    -   Cons for Franchisee: Less autonomy.

Legal Issues in Product Design:
-   Legal Liability: An obligation or debt.
    -   Strict Liability: Can be imposed if a product was dangerous/defective, the defect existed when it left control, defect caused harm, and harm is assignable to the defect.
-   Tort: A wrongful act (not a breach of contract) for which a civil suit can be brought.
    -   Negligence: Failure to follow reasonable standards, resulting in harm. Requires proving duty of care, breach of duty, harm, and causation.

Legal Issues in Entrepreneurship (General):
-   Licensing and permit issues (business licenses, industry-specific permits).
-   Advertisement and marketing regulations.
-   Infrastructure-related Zonal Laws.
-   Data Protection and Privacy Issues.
-   Protection of intellectual property rights (as above).
-   Contract Management (with suppliers, customers, employees).
-   Tortious Liabilities.
