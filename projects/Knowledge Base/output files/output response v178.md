# Question, briefly
The problem asks us to find the minimum "window size" of changes required in a given instruction string `str` (composed of 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R') to enable reaching a target coordinate `(x, y)` starting from `(0, 0)` in exactly `n` steps, where `n` is the length of `str`. A "window" is defined by the first and last indices of the string that are modified; its size is `(last_changed_index - first_changed_index + 1)`. If it's impossible to reach `(x, y)` in `n` steps even with modifications, we should return -1.

# Answer
The problem can be solved by performing a binary search on the possible window size `w`. The window size can range from `0` (no changes allowed) to `n` (the entire string can be changed).

First, there's an initial check for impossibility:
Let `tarx` and `tary` be the target coordinates. The minimum number of steps required to reach `(tarx, tary)` is `min_req_dist = abs(tarx) + abs(tary)`.
If `min_req_dist > n` (target is too far for `n` steps) or if `(n - min_req_dist) % 2 != 0` (parity mismatch, as any extra steps beyond `min_req_dist` must come in pairs like 'U' then 'D' to cancel out), then it's impossible to reach the target. In this case, return -1.

If the initial check passes, we proceed with the binary search for `w` in the range `[0, n]`.
For a given window size `w` being tested in the binary search, we need a function `check(w)` that determines if there's *any* contiguous subsegment of `str` of length `w` which, if its instructions are optimally changed, allows us to reach `(tarx, tary)`.

The `check(w)` function works as follows:
1.  Precompute prefix sums for displacements. Let `prefix_dx[k]` and `prefix_dy[k]` store the total change in x and y coordinates respectively, from the first `k` instructions of the original string `str[0...k-1]`. `prefix_dx[0] = prefix_dy[0] = 0`.
2.  Iterate through all possible starting positions `j` for a window of length `w`. The window would span indices `j` to `j+w-1`. `j` ranges from `0` to `n-w`.
    *   The instructions *before* the window are `str[0...j-1]`. Their displacement is `(dx_before, dy_before) = (prefix_dx[j], prefix_dy[j])`.
    *   The instructions *after* the window are `str[j+w...n-1]`. Their displacement, relative to if they started at (0,0), is `(dx_after, dy_after)`. This can be calculated as:
        `dx_after = prefix_dx[n] - prefix_dx[j+w]`
        `dy_after = prefix_dy[n] - prefix_dy[j+w]`
    *   The total displacement from the fixed parts (those outside the window) is `(fixed_dx, fixed_dy) = (dx_before + dx_after, dy_before + dy_after)`.
    *   Therefore, the displacement that must be achieved by the `w` instructions *within* the window is `(needed_dx_window, needed_dy_window) = (tarx - fixed_dx, tary - fixed_dy)`.
    *   The minimum number of steps required to achieve this displacement `(needed_dx_window, needed_dy_window)` is `min_steps_in_window = abs(needed_dx_window) + abs(needed_dy_window)`.
    *   For this window starting at `j` to be a valid choice:
        a.  `min_steps_in_window <= w`: The required displacement must be achievable within `w` steps.
        b.  `(w - min_steps_in_window) % 2 == 0`: Any steps remaining out of `w` (i.e., `w - min_steps_in_window`) must be used for pairs of moves that cancel each other out (e.g., 'U' then 'D'). Thus, this difference must be even.
    *   If both conditions (a) and (b) are met for any `j`, then `check(w)` returns true.
3.  If the loop finishes without finding such a `j`, `check(w)` returns false.

The binary search proceeds:
- If `check(w)` is true, it means a window of size `w` works. We try for a smaller window: store `w` as a potential answer and set `high = w - 1`.
- If `check(w)` is false, `w` is too small. We need a larger window: set `low = w + 1`.

The final answer is the smallest `w` for which `check(w)` was true.

The time complexity will be `O(N log N)` because the binary search performs `log N` iterations, and each `check(w)` call takes `O(N)` time due to iterating through possible window start positions. Prefix sums are computed once in `O(N)`. This complexity is suitable for `N` up to `2 * 10^5`.

# Explanation

The problem asks for the minimum length of a contiguous subsegment (window) of an instruction string. By changing instructions only within this window, we must be able to reach a target coordinate `(tarx, tary)` from `(0,0)` in exactly `n` steps (the total length of the string).

## Initial Feasibility Check
Before searching for the window, we determine if reaching the target is even possible.
- The minimum number of steps to reach `(tarx, tary)` is its Manhattan distance from the origin: `dist = abs(tarx) + abs(tary)`.
- If `dist > n`, we don't have enough steps, so it's impossible.
- Each step changes the Manhattan distance to the current coordinate from origin by +1 or -1. To end up at a location `dist` away in `n` steps, `n` and `dist` must have the same parity. This is because `n - dist` steps must be "wasted" in pairs of opposing moves (like 'U' then 'D'), each pair consuming 2 steps. So, `n - dist` must be an even non-negative number. If `(n - dist) % 2 != 0`, it's impossible.
- If either of these conditions makes it impossible, we return -1.

## Binary Search on Window Size (`w`)
The core idea is that if a window of size `w` allows us to reach the target, any window of size `w' > w` might also allow it (by simply including more unchanged original instructions or more canceling pairs). This monotonicity allows binary searching for the minimum `w`.
- `w` can range from `0` (no changes) to `n` (entire string can be changed).
- We binary search for the smallest `w` in `[0, n]` for which a function `check(w)` returns true.

## `check(w)` Function Details
This function verifies if *any* window of a given size `w` can satisfy the problem's conditions.
1.  **Prefix Sums**: To efficiently calculate displacements of segments of the original string, we precompute prefix sums of `dx` (change in x) and `dy` (change in y).
    `prefix_dx[k]` = sum of `dx` from `str[0]` to `str[k-1]`.
    `prefix_dy[k]` = sum of `dy` from `str[0]` to `str[k-1]`.
    Base case: `prefix_dx[0] = 0`, `prefix_dy[0] = 0`.
    A move 'U' is (0,1), 'D' is (0,-1), 'L' is (-1,0), 'R' is (1,0).

2.  **Iterating Window Positions**: For a window of length `w`, its starting index `j` can range from `0` to `n-w`. The window covers `str[j...j+w-1]`.
    *   **Displacement from Fixed Prefix**: The part `str[0...j-1]` is unchanged. Its displacement is `(P_dx, P_dy) = (prefix_dx[j], prefix_dy[j])`.
    *   **Displacement from Fixed Suffix**: The part `str[j+w...n-1]` is unchanged. Its displacement is `(S_dx, S_dy)`. This is calculated as the displacement of `str[0...n-1]` minus the displacement of `str[0...j+w-1]`:
        `S_dx = prefix_dx[n] - prefix_dx[j+w]`
        `S_dy = prefix_dy[n] - prefix_dy[j+w]`
    *   **Total Fixed Displacement**: The sum of displacements from prefix and suffix:
        `fixed_dx = P_dx + S_dx`
        `fixed_dy = P_dy + S_dy`
    *   **Required Window Displacement**: To reach `(tarx, tary)`, the `w` instructions in the window `str[j...j+w-1]` must provide the remaining displacement:
        `needed_dx = tarx - fixed_dx`
        `needed_dy = tary - fixed_dy`
    *   **Steps for Window Displacement**: The minimum steps to achieve `(needed_dx, needed_dy)` is `min_window_steps = abs(needed_dx) + abs(needed_dy)`.
    *   **Validation for current `j`**:
        1.  `min_window_steps <= w`: The window must be large enough to make the required displacement.
        2.  `(w - min_window_steps) % 2 == 0`: Any "extra" steps within the window (`w - min_window_steps`) must be even, as they'll be used for pairs of canceling moves (e.g., L then R).

    If both validation conditions are met for any `j`, it means a window of size `w` can work, so `check(w)` returns true. If no `j` works, `check(w)` returns false.

## Example Walkthrough (Conceptual)
Consider `str = "URURR"`, `n=5`, target `(3, -2)`.
Initial check: `abs(3) + abs(-2) = 5`. `n=5`. `5 <= 5` and `(5-5)%2 == 0`. Possible.
Binary search for `w` in `[0,5]`. Suppose `w=3`.
`check(3)`:
- Try `j=0`. Window `str[0...2]` ("URU").
    - Fixed prefix `str[-1]` (empty): `(P_dx,P_dy) = (0,0)`.
    - Fixed suffix `str[3...4]` ("RR"). Original displacement of "RR" is `(2,0)`.
        `prefix_dx = [0,0,1,1,2,3]`, `prefix_dy = [0,1,1,2,2,2]`.
        `j=0, w=3`. `j+w=3`.
        `P_dx = prefix_dx[0] = 0`, `P_dy = prefix_dy[0] = 0`.
        `S_dx = prefix_dx[5] - prefix_dx[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`.
        `S_dy = prefix_dy[5] - prefix_dy[3] = 2 - 2 = 0`.
    - `fixed_dx = 0+2 = 2`, `fixed_dy = 0+0 = 0`.
    - `needed_dx = 3-2 = 1`, `needed_dy = -2-0 = -2`.
    - `min_window_steps = abs(1) + abs(-2) = 3`.
    - Validation: `min_window_steps (3) <= w (3)`. True. `(w - min_window_steps) = (3-3) = 0`. `0%2 == 0`. True.
    - Since conditions met for `j=0`, `check(3)` returns true.
The binary search would then try smaller `w`. If `ans` becomes 3, this matches the example.

This structured approach ensures finding the minimum window size efficiently.
