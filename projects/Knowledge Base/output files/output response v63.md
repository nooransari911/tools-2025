Version 2 (`PDC v2.md`) is the better version.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Structure and Clarity:** Version 2 uses a direct `### Question:` followed by the answer format. This makes it extremely clear which specific question is being addressed in each subsection, improving readability and focus, especially for reviewing answers to a known list of questions. Version 1 lists the questions covered at the start of a topic block, which is less direct.
2.  **Conciseness:** While both aim for conciseness, Version 2 often presents the information in slightly tighter bullet points and phrasing.
3.  **Focus:** Version 2 generally groups answers more logically under the specific question asked. For example, device limitations and applications are handled under dedicated question sections, whereas Version 1 integrates some of this information into broader comparison sections, making it slightly less focused on answering *that specific question*.
4.  **Directness:** The Q&A format of Version 2 directly mirrors the likely source (a list of practical questions) and provides explicit answers, fulfilling the user requirement for focused responses.

Overall, Version 2's structure and slightly more concise presentation make it easier to use as a reference for specific questions.
