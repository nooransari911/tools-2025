Okay, let's start by going through the provided document structure and extracted content to build a comprehensive set of study notes following the instructions. I'll need to carefully process and reorganize the information, extracting key definitions, concepts, and illustrative examples while maintaining the precise structure outlined in the plan. I'll avoid formatting, organize information in a clear hierarchy, and ensure all technical terms are properly explained, especially regarding algorithm design and analysis.

The content covers algorithms and data structures across multiple chapters and files, so the document is quite detailed. I'll need to ensure all key concepts are adequately addressed without redundancy or omitting essential parts. Maintaining clarity and logical flow is crucial, especially given the depth of technical material.

Let me start by processing each item in order:

1. File `foundations_overview.md`: This introduces algorithms, correctness, data structures, problem types like sorting, graph problems, and hard problems including NP-complete. It shows divide-and-conquer method with merge sort as an example. The asymptotic notation section covers Theta, Big-O, Omega, little-o, and little-omega notations.

2. Files `PartI Foundations Algorithms.md`, `PartI Foundations/C2 Getting Started.md`, and `PartI Foundations/C3 Characterizing Running Times.md`: These delve into insertion sort, loop invariants, algorithm analysis (worst-case, average-case, order of growth), divide-and-conquer algorithms like merge sort, recurrence relations, and formal definitions of asymptotic notations.

3. Files in Parts III to II (Data Structures, Sorting and Order Statistics, etc.): These discuss data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists, hash tables, binary search trees, red-black trees), sorting algorithms (heapsort, quicksort, linear-time sorts like counting, radix, bucket), order statistics, and selection algorithms.

I'll structure the final notes around these core areas, ensuring key examples and structural elements (like pseudocode for insertion sort, merge sort, heap operations) are clearly explained. Each main topic will have subsections that build upon basic concepts towards more complex algorithms and analyses.

# Algorithms and Data Structures Study Notes

## Foundations of Algorithms

### Core Concepts
- Algorithm: Well-defined computational procedure transforming input to output in finite time.
- Computational problem defines input/output relationship; problem instance is specific input.
- Correct algorithm halts with correct output for all instances.
- Data structure: Organizes data for efficient access/updates; no single structure fits all purposes.

### Problem Types and Approaches
- Sorting: Insertion sort (incremental approach).
- Graph problems: Shortest paths, topological sort.
- Numerical problems: Matrix multiplication, FFT.
- Hard problems: NP-complete problems (e.g., traveling-salesperson) often use approximation algorithms.

### Divide-and-Conquer
- Approach: Divide (split), conquer (recursively solve subproblems), combine.
- Example: Merge sort divides array in half, sorts subarrays recursively, then merges in Θ(n) time.
- Recurrence: T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(n) → T(n) = Θ(n log n).

## Algorithm Analysis

### Input Size and Running Time
- Input size (n) varies by problem: number of items (sorting), total bits (multiplier).
- Running time T(n): Count of primitive operations in RAM model.
- RAM model: Sequential instruction execution, constant time for basic operations.

### Analysis Types
- Worst-case: T(n) = max over all inputs of size n.
- Average-case: T(n) = expectation over input distributions.
- Order of growth: Focus on leading term, ignore constants.

## Asymptotic Notation

### Common Notations
- Θ(g(n)): Asymptotically tight bound.
- O(g(n)): Asymptotic upper bound.
- Ω(g(n)): Asymptotic lower bound.
- o(g(n)), Ω+(g(n)): Not asymptotically tight bounds.

### Formal Definitions (for f(n) and g(n) ≥ 0):
- Θ(g(n)) = {f(n): c₁g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c₂g(n) for n ≥ n₀}.
- O(g(n)) = {f(n): f(n) ≤ cg(n) for n ≥ n₀}.
- Ω(g(n)) = {f(n): f(n) ≥ cg(n) for n ≥ n₀}.
- o(g(n)) = {f(n): limₙ→∞ f(n)/g(n) = 0}.
- Ω+(g(n)) = {f(n): limₙ→∞ f(n)/g(n) = ∞}.

### Notation Properties
- Transitivity holds.
- Reflexivity and symmetry properties simplify analysis.
- Trichotomy does **not** generally hold for functions (e.g., n and n¹+sin(n)).

## Data Structures

### Elementary Structures
- **Stacks**: LAST-IN-FIRST-OUT (LIFO) with PUSH, POP.
- **Queues**: FIRST-IN-FIRST-OUT (FIFO) with ENQUEUE, DEQUEUE.
- **Stack/Queue Implementations**: Static arrays with top/tail counters; overflow/underflow handled explicitly.

### Linked Lists
- **Singly/Doubly Linked**: Elements contain next/prev pointers.
- Operations: Insert with LIST-PREPEND in O(1) given position.
- SEARCH and DELETE take O(n) in worst case.

### Tree Structures
- Binary Tree: Node has left/right child pointers.
- **Red-Black Trees**: Height h ⇒ black-height bh = number of black nodes on any path from node to leaves.
- **Insert/Delete Fixup**: Involves up to 2 rotations plus recoloring (RB-INSERT-FIXUP).

## Sorting Algorithms

### Comparison Sorts
- Heapsort: O(n log n), 1. Do MAX-HEAPIFY (sink down), BUILD-MAX-HEAP (linear time).
- Quicksort: O(n log n) expected time, Θ(n²) worst-case:
  - RANDOMIZED-PARTITION selects pivot uniformly at random.
  - PARTITION maintains loop invariant to separate low/high elements.

### Linear Time Sorts
- **Counting Sort**: Θ(n + k) for numbers in 0-k.
- **Radix Sort**: Sorts d-digit numbers in Θ(d(n + k)) time.
- **Bucket Sort**: Assumptions of uniform [0, 1) inputs yield O(n) expected time.

## Advanced Topics and Recurrence Analysis

### Recurrence Solution Methods
- Substitution Method: Guess form and apply induction.
- Recursion Tree: Represent work at each recursion level.
- Master Theorem: Solve T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n) by:
  - Compare f(n) with n^(log_b a).

### Divide-and-Conquer Examples
- Matrix Multiplication: Simple divide approach gives Θ(n³); Strassen’s improves to O(n^{2.81}).
- Randomized Algorithms: Expectation analysis using indicator variables (e.g., hiring problem expected cost Θ(c_h ln n)).

## Data Structure Implementation Notes

### Hash Tables
- Chaining: Resolve collisions via linked lists (CHAINED-HASH-INSERT).
- Open addressing: Collision resolution with probing (HASH-INSERT, HASH-SEARCH).

### Tree Implementations
- Binary Search Trees: INSERT/DELETE require careful pointer updates.
- Tree Traversal: INORDER-TREE-WALK for sorted output.

Each section synthesizes core concepts from the document, highlighting major algorithms, asymptotic behavior, and structure implementation strategies.
