# The Shifting Calculus of Modern Firepower: How Modern Rocket Launch Systems Render Conventional Artillery Obsolete
## Introduction

The efficacy of land-based fire support systems in modern warfare is critically dependent on the interplay between munition lethality, platform survivability, and the resilience of logistical chains, particularly ammunition resupply. This article undertakes a detailed two-part analysis, directly engaging with the argument that conventional tube artillery, due to fundamental and systemic vulnerabilities, faces profound challenges in the contemporary high-intensity battlespace. The first part will conduct an in-depth comparative examination of resupply mechanisms, arguing that conventional artillery resupply is inherently fragile and exposes platforms to unacceptable risks, a stark contrast to the more resilient doctrinal and mechanical designs underpinning Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS). The second part will build upon this resupply vulnerability analysis, integrating it with broader operational considerations related to inherent platform vulnerabilities during the engagement cycle itself. It will explore how these factors, including the critical metric of "impact per unit of risk," coalesce to relegate traditional artillery, especially towed and less advanced self-propelled variants, from the "cutting edge" of military capability when arrayed against a peer or near-peer adversary. The purpose is to dissect these complexities, providing a robust understanding of why specific operational characteristics are increasingly rendering older artillery concepts untenable.

## PART I: THE CONTRAST OF RESUPPLY MODELS: ARTILLERY’S FUNDAMENTAL WEAKNESS VS. MLRS’ STRUCTURAL RESILIENCE

The capacity for sustained and effective fire, a linchpin of combat power, is fundamentally governed by the security and efficiency of ammunition resupply. The divergent approaches to ammunition design, handling protocols, and resupply doctrine between conventional artillery and modern MLRS generate a critical disparity in operational vulnerability and system resilience, particularly under the duress of peer-level conflict.

### The Natural Fragility of Artillery

The resupply chain supporting conventional tube artillery (both 105mm and 155mm systems) is characterized by a series of interconnected processes and dependencies that, when viewed holistically, reveal a systemic fragility. This vulnerability is not merely a minor constraint but a critical flaw in a sensor-rich, high-tempo battlefield.

#### Fragmented Ammunition and Manual Handling
Artillery ammunition—comprising separate projectiles, propellant charges, and fuzes—necessitates intricate handling at multiple stages. This multipart nature inherently prolongs every step of the resupply process, from loading at depots to preparation at the gun line. Each "shot" requires the coordination and assembly of several items, magnifying the time crews are exposed and static, particularly during direct replenishment of the firing platform or nearby Ammunition Points (APs). This extended handling time directly contributes to the "death trap" scenario: the longer a system is immobile and active, the higher its probability of detection and engagement by enemy counter-fire.

#### Predictable Logistical Signatures
Resupplying artillery, especially for sustained operations, requires a significant and continuous flow of materiel. This often involves numerous standard military cargo trucks. While an individual truck might possess a generic signature, the *pattern* and *volume* of logistical movements associated with an active artillery unit do not. Convoys moving toward suspected firing areas, the congregation of vehicles at APs, and the repetitive nature of these activities create a discernible and predictable signature for modern ISR assets. Adversaries can exploit these patterns, targeting not just individual resupply vehicles but also the predictable choke points and APs that are essential to the artillery's functioning. The "100 trucks" argument is salient here: an adversary doesn't need to identify each vehicle's specific cargo; the sheer concentration and flow of logistics toward forward artillery positions become a legitimate and high-value target set by virtue of their critical enabling role.

#### Cascading Consequences of Interdiction
The reliance on this voluminous and often forward-positioned resupply makes artillery exceptionally vulnerable to interdiction. Disruption doesn't just mean a temporary pause in firing; it triggers a cascade of negative consequences. Guns run dry, becoming inert steel—"vulnerable targets"—while still representing a target. For towed artillery, any attempt to displace without ammunition or under threat of imminent attack becomes a slow, chaotic retreat, catastrophically disrupting operational plans and unit cohesion. Even for SPGs, an interruption in resupply forces difficult choices: remain in a potentially compromised position hoping for replenishment, or withdraw, ceding ground and momentum. The psychological impact on crews facing dwindling ammunition supplies in a high-threat environment, knowing their resupply is under attack and their primary defense (counter-fire or displacement) is compromised, is profoundly demoralizing. This is a core element of the "death trap"—not just physical destruction, but operational paralysis and psychological defeat.

### MLRS Resupply: Engineered for Survivability

In stark contrast, modern MLRS resupply is designed around principles that mitigate many of artillery's inherent vulnerabilities, emphasizing speed, unitized loads, and doctrinal separation of the launcher from the most vulnerable resupply phases.

#### Preloaded Munition Pods
The defining feature of MLRS resupply is the use of pre-loaded, sealed rocket pods/canisters. This transforms resupply from a laborious, component-by-component process into a swift, mechanized exchange of large "blocks" of firepower. A specialized Resupply Vehicle (RSV) with an integrated crane can reload an MLRS launcher (e.g., a HIMARS with a 6-rocket pod) in minutes. This drastically reduces the time the launcher is static and dedicated to resupply.

#### Decentralized, Transient Resupply Points
Crucially, MLRS doctrine dictates that launchers, after expending their munitions using "shoot-and-scoot" tactics, withdraw from forward firing positions to designated Resupply Points (RSPs). These RSPs are typically located further to the rear than artillery APs, in less directly threatened areas, and can be transient. This separation means the highly valuable launcher platform is not co-located with bulk ammunition stores during the most intensive phase of resupply activity, nor is it tied to a static AP near the front.

#### Minimized Exposure During Transfer
While MLRS RSVs are specialized and possess a unique signature, making them high-value targets if identified, their operational concept aims to mitigate this. By meeting launchers at dispersed and temporary RSPs, and by the launchers themselves spending minimal time at these points, the window for targeting the RSV during the actual resupply act with the launcher present is narrowed. The challenge for the adversary becomes finding these transient RSPs or interdicting RSVs en route through a larger, less predictable area, as opposed to focusing on more static and predictable artillery APs or gun lines.

### Persistent Resupply Deficits in Self-Propelled Guns

While modern SPGs have dramatically improved their own "shoot-and-scoot" capabilities, the fundamental nature of their ammunition and the scale of their consumption mean their resupply chain retains significant vulnerabilities compared to MLRS. An SPG might displace rapidly after firing, but it still needs to be replenished with individual shells and charges. This replenishment, whether from pre-stocked forward caches (which themselves become targets) or directly from resupply vehicles, still involves the handling of componentized ammunition and often occurs in areas more forward than MLRS RSPs. The "Achilles' heel" of resupply, therefore, casts a longer shadow over SPG operations, as the logistical tail supporting them must still contend with the risks of volume, component handling, and forward proximity, even if the firing platform itself is more agile.

## PART II: PLATFORM LIMITATIONS AND TACTICAL IRRELEVANCE

The vulnerabilities inherent in artillery resupply, as detailed in Part I, represent a critical flaw. However, the challenges facing conventional artillery in modern, high-intensity warfare, particularly when assessing its position at the "cutting edge" against peer adversaries, stem from an even broader set of operational characteristics. These inherent platform vulnerabilities, related to engagement cycle, mobility, exposure, and importantly, the "impact per unit of risk," contribute significantly to the "death trap" paradigm, often compounded by, but distinct from, the fragility of its logistical support.

### Modern Battlefield Dynamics: A Landscape of Rapid Detection and Instant Kinetic Response

The modern battlefield is an environment of unprecedented transparency, fueled by ubiquitous Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) assets. This transparency is coupled with highly networked command and control systems that dramatically compress sensor-to-shooter timelines, enabling rapid and precise engagement of detected targets. In such a crucible, systems that are inherently slow to react, possess limited tactical agility, or require prolonged periods of static exposure become prime candidates for swift neutralization. The premium is on platforms that can deliver decisive effects quickly, minimize their own exposure, and maintain operational tempo even under duress.

### Artillery’s Structural Vulnerabilities

Beyond the resupply Achilles' heel, several intrinsic characteristics of towed and older/less advanced self-propelled artillery render them exceptionally vulnerable in high-intensity peer conflict, solidifying the "death trap" designation.

#### Prolonged Emplacement/Displacement
A fundamental vulnerability of traditional artillery, especially towed guns, is the significant time required to emplace the system for firing and subsequently to displace it after an engagement. This process, often taking many minutes, transforms the artillery piece and its crew into a static, exposed target. During this entire period of preparation and teardown, the unit is incapable of effective self-defense or rapid evasion. Modern counter-battery radar and other ISR systems can detect firing signatures or even the activity of emplacement, cueing precision fires that can arrive before the artillery unit has any chance to move. This inherent slowness in transitioning between movement, firing, and movement again is a primary contributor to their vulnerability.

#### Inherent Mobility Deficits
Towed artillery, by its very nature, relies on a prime mover. Its off-road mobility is limited by the capabilities of this separate vehicle and the towability of the gun itself. Even older SPGs often lack the agility and speed of more modern designs or wheeled rocket launchers. This impaired mobility means that once a firing position is compromised, or if counter-battery fire is anticipated or detected, the ability to rapidly "scoot" to a new, safer location is severely limited. They become, in effect, "stuck," unable to effectively evade threats.

#### Inefficient Fire-to-Survival Ratios
Compared to the salvo capabilities of MLRS, individual artillery tubes have a significantly lower rate of fire. To achieve a substantial tactical effect on a target, an artillery piece must often remain in its firing position for an extended duration, sequentially delivering rounds. Each minute spent firing directly increases its exposure and risk of counter-battery action. This contrasts sharply with MLRS, which can deliver a full salvo of multiple, often precision-guided, rockets nearly simultaneously. This concentrated burst of firepower maximizes the tactical impact (shock, destruction of multiple aimpoints, area saturation if needed) achieved within an extremely brief window of vulnerability. Consequently, MLRS offers a vastly superior "impact per unit of risk," or "impact per minute of exposure," compared to traditional artillery, which must trade prolonged exposure for cumulative effect.

#### Manpower Density Risks
Towed artillery pieces typically require larger crews to operate them efficiently. More personnel concentrated around each weapon system equates to higher potential casualties should the position be targeted.

These inherent platform characteristics—slow reaction times, limited tactical agility, and a poor impact-to-risk ratio during firing—create a "death trap" scenario *even before considering the vulnerabilities of resupply*. When the fragile, time-consuming, and often forward-positioned resupply process is overlaid onto these existing platform vulnerabilities, the risk to artillery units is compounded exponentially.

### MLRS Superiority: Effect Density Over Exposure Time

#### Intense Decisive Salvos and Mobility-First Architecture
Modern MLRS platforms are designed to excel in this high-stakes equation of impact versus risk. Their "shoot-and-scoot" capability allows them to halt, unleash a devastating salvo of multiple, often precision-guided rockets in seconds, and immediately displace. The near-simultaneous arrival of this salvo provides a concentrated tactical effect—whether for precision strike or area suppression—that is difficult for slower, sequential artillery fire to match in terms of immediate shock and destructive power for a given time of exposure. This ability to deliver a high volume of effect during minimal exposure fundamentally defines their superior "impact per risk" profile. Their wheeled chassis (like HIMARS) often affords excellent road speed and good off-road mobility, enabling rapid redeployment or withdrawal.

### Terminal Inadequacy of Even Modern SPGs

Modern, highly advanced Self-Propelled Guns (e.g., Archer, PzH 2000, K9 Thunder) represent a significant leap forward, drastically reducing "into-action" and "out-of-action" times and often incorporating Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact (MRSI) capabilities. MRSI allows a single SPG to land several shells on a target at almost the same time, attempting to emulate the salvo effect of MLRS and improve its own impact-to-risk ratio.

However, even with MRSI, an SPG is typically delivering fewer projectiles simultaneously compared to a full MLRS rocket pod. To achieve an effect comparable to a 6-rocket GMLRS salvo, an SPG would either need more time on station (firing multiple MRSI bursts or simply more rounds sequentially) or require multiple SPGs firing in coordination, which increases the collective signature and complexity. Thus, while vastly superior to older artillery, even advanced SPGs often struggle to match the sheer concentrated "impact per risk" that MLRS can achieve with a single, rapid salvo from one platform. Furthermore, the persistent resupply challenges and, for some models, weight-related strategic mobility constraints, remain factors.

### Redefining Combat Relevance in Peer Conflict

The "cutting edge" in a peer conflict is increasingly defined by the ability to deliver decisive, precise effects with maximum tactical impact for minimal platform exposure, supported by a resilient logistical framework. Systems that require prolonged static periods for operation or resupply, or that offer a less favorable ratio of destructive effect to time-at-risk, are ill-suited for the demands of such a conflict.

The argument that artillery is a "death trap" in this context stems directly from its inability to reconcile its operational characteristics—including a generally lower "impact per risk" during engagements—with the tempo and lethality of the modern battlespace. This is critically exacerbated by a fragile and time-consuming resupply process.

## CONCLUSION: TOWARD NEW FIREPOWER DOCTRINES

In the unforgiving environment of modern peer-level conflict, the inherent operational characteristics of traditional artillery—particularly towed and older self-propelled systems—render them profoundly vulnerable. Their slow reaction times, prolonged exposure during firing and displacement cycles, limited tactical agility, and a less favorable "impact per unit of risk" directly contribute to a "death trap" scenario. This predicament is made even more acute by the systemic fragilities of their resupply chain.

Modern MLRS, with its emphasis on rapid "shoot-and-scoot" precision salvos that maximize tactical impact within minimal exposure windows, offers a more viable model for survivability and effectiveness. While advanced SPGs represent a commendable evolution, striving to mitigate the traditional shortcomings of tube artillery and improve their own impact delivery, they still often operate under greater constraints regarding the sheer concentration of effect per unit of risk, alongside resupply complexity, compared to their rocket-propelled counterparts.

Consequently, the "cutting edge" of land-based fire support against peer adversaries is increasingly characterized by systems that embody speed, precision, maximized impact for minimal exposure, and logistical efficiency. This paradigm shift continues to challenge the traditional role of artillery, pushing it away from the forefront of high-intensity combat unless its fundamental vulnerabilities in both platform operation—especially concerning the optimization of "impact per risk"—and logistical sustenance can be radically overcome.
