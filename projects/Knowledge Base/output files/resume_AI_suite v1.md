# Detailed Reference Resume (For Interview Prep)

## Technical Experience with AI/Cloud Development

**AI Applications and Models**
- Built AI chatbots and document processing systems using:
    - Claude 3.7 Sonnet (AWS Bedrock) with text/image processing
    - DeepSeek R1 (AWS Bedrock) for specialized text processing
    - Gemini 2.0 Pro/Flash for parallel document analysis
- Utilized both synchronous and batch inference modes
- Implemented multimodal processing (text, PDF, images)

**Parallel Processing Implementation**
- Developed two parallel processing systems:
    - File-level parallelism for document processing
    - Directory-level parallelism for batch operations
- Used Python multiprocessing with process pools and futures
- Implemented async/await for non-blocking operations (token counting)

**Software Architecture**
- Designed modular components following single responsibility principle
- Created independent modules for:
    - Model configuration and interaction
    - Input/output processing across multiple formats
    - System configuration using environment variables
    - Error handling and logging
- Built clean interfaces for model interactions and response handling

**AWS Integration**
- Used AWS Bedrock for AI model inference
- Implemented IAM role-based security (assume role pattern)
- Utilized S3 for file operations
- Integrated batch inference capabilities
- Developed error handling for cloud operations

This restructured reference version:
1. Organizes information into clear functional areas
2. Maintains all technical details while improving readability
3. Provides clear context for interview discussions
4. Accurately represents implementation depth
5. Avoids redundancy while preserving important details
6. Better supports the condensed versions in your other resumes
