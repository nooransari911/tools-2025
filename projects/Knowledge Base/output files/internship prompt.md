I understand your instructions for creating a new document based on two files that you'll upload:

1. A template file (PDF or plain text converted from PDF)
2. A supplementary file with domain-specific/technical information

Your instructions are clear, and I'll:

- Analyze the template's structure, formatting, style, and organization
- Extract domain-specific information from the supplementary file
- Create a new document following the template's structure
- Integrate the technical information appropriately
- Ask clarifying questions for any gaps
- Note inferred structural elements if working from plain text

I'll wait for you to upload both files before proceeding with the analysis and document creation.
