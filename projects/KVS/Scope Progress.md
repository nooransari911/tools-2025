# What is Done (The Solid Foundation)

You have successfully completed the most critical and difficult part: the core architecture and the primary application logic.

*   **✅ Public API Layer:**
    *   The `Carinae` service is the complete, high-level orchestrator.
    *   The `CarinaeServiceInterface` contract is stable and well-defined.
    *   The standardized `ApiResponse` envelope provides a consistent, professional contract for all clients.

*   **✅ Core Data Models:**
    *   All data structures (`KvsRecord`, `KvsEntry`, `KvsKey`) and metadata structures (`MetadataInterface`, `BaseMetadataInterface`, etc.) are fully defined and stable.

*   **✅ Core Business Logic:**
    *   The logic for creating and updating records, including versioning, timestamping, and managing revision history, is correctly implemented and encapsulated within the `Metadata` service.
    *   The state management pattern (instantiating `Metadata` as a scoped manager) is correct and robust against race conditions.

*   **✅ Service Abstractions (The Contracts):**
    *   The interfaces for all low-level services (`CoreStorageServiceInterface`, `KeyServiceInterface`, `LockServiceInterface`, `HashingServiceInterface`) are defined. This is crucial because it means the high-level application logic is completely decoupled from the low-level implementations.

*   **✅ A Working (In-Memory) Implementation:**
    *   `MemoryStorage` provides a complete, working implementation of the storage contract, making the system runnable for testing and development right now.

# What Remains (The Path to Production)

These are the concrete implementations and new features needed to build upon your solid foundation.

## Tier 1: Core Service Implementations (Essential for basic functionality)

*   **⚫ Hashing Service:**
    *   **Pending:** A concrete `HashingService` class that implements `HashingServiceInterface` using a standard library (like Node.js's `crypto` module for SHA-256).

*   **⚫ Lock Service:**
    *   **Pending:** A concrete `LockService` class. This could be a simple in-process implementation (using a library like `async-mutex`) or a distributed one for multi-node deployments (e.g., using Redis).

*   **⚫ Key Service:**
    *   **Pending:** A concrete `KeyService` class that implements the `Encode` and `Decode` methods (e.g., joining namespaces with `/` and the file with `:`).

*   **⚫ Persistent Storage:**
    *   **Pending:** One or more classes that implement `CoreStorageServiceInterface` for persistent storage, such as a `FileStorageService` (writing JSON to disk) or a `RedisStorageService`.

## Tier 2: Production Features (Essential for a robust system)

*   **⚫ Data Expiration (TTL):**
    *   **Pending:** A "janitor" process. The `ExpiresAt` field exists in your metadata, but nothing currently enforces it. You need a background process that periodically scans the store and calls `Delete` on expired keys.

*   **⚫ Events & Observability:**
    *   **Pending:** An `EventService` or emitter. `Carinae`'s methods (`Set`, `Delete`) should emit events (e.g., `key:set`, `key:delete`). This is the foundation for logging, auditing, replication, and reactivity.

*   **⚫ Dependency Injection Container:**
    *   **Pending:** A proper DI container (like `tsyringe` or `InversifyJS`) to manage the instantiation and wiring of all these services, instead of doing it manually.

## Tier 3: Advanced Features (To create a powerful, next-level KVS)

*   **⚫ Reactivity / Subscriptions:**
    *   **Pending:** A `SubscriptionService` built on top of the event system. This would allow clients to `subscribe("my/key")` and receive real-time updates when that key's data changes.

*   **⚫ Schema Validation:**
    *   **Pending:** A `SchemaService` that validates incoming data against a predefined schema (e.g., JSON Schema) before it's stored, using the `SchemaHash` in the metadata.

*   **⚫ Querying and Indexing:**
    *   **Pending:** The ability to find keys based on metadata (e.g., "find all keys with the tag 'active-user'"). This requires a separate `IndexingService`.

*   **⚫ Transactions:**
    *   **Pending:** A transaction manager to allow for atomic `Set` or `Delete` operations across multiple keys.
