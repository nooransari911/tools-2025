# Action Plan: Add Font Selection to Resume Editor

1.  **Integrate Google Fonts:**
    *   Update `src/app/layout.tsx` to import all the required fonts from Google Fonts: Inter, Lora, Baskervville, Libre Baskerville, and Times New Roman.

2.  **Update Resume State:**
    *   Modify the `Resume` type in `src/lib/types.ts` to include a `font` property.
    *   Update the initial resume data in `src/app/page.tsx` to include a default font.

3.  **Create Font Selection Dropdown:**
    *   In `src/components/resume/EditorSidebar.tsx`, add a new `Select` component for font selection.
    *   The `Select` component should be populated with the available font options.
    *   On selection, it should dispatch an action to update the `font` in the resume state.

4.  **Dynamically Apply Font to Preview:**
    *   In `src/components/resume/ResumePreview.tsx`, get the selected font from the resume state.
    *   Apply the corresponding `font-family` to the main container element of the resume preview.
    *   Use a utility function to map font names to their CSS `font-family` values.

5.  **Ensure Font is Applied to PDF Export:**
    *   Verify that the font change in the preview is reflected in the PDF generated by `handlePrint` in `EditorSidebar.tsx`. The existing logic should capture the styles, but this needs to be confirmed.
