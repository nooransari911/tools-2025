# Introduction
NestJS is a backend framework for building robust, reliable, efficient, scalable NodeJS applications.


It uses Typescript and Angular architecture.


NestJS solves the problem of architecture. It provides out-of-the-box application architecture which allows devs to create highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled and easily maintainable applications.



# Initialize
After installing npm:

```
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
nest new project-name
```
