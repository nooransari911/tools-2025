            "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary advantage of using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) over feedforward neural networks for sequential data?",
            "answer": "RNNs maintain an internal state that allows them to process sequential data with temporal dependencies.",
            "explanation": "Feedforward networks process each input independently, ignoring the order. RNNs, however, use their hidden state to incorporate information from previous inputs, making them suitable for sequences.",

            "question": "Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization.",
            "answer": "L1 regularization (Lasso) adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the weights, leading to sparse solutions (some weights become zero). L2 regularization (Ridge) adds a penalty proportional to the square of the weights, leading to smaller weights but not necessarily zero.",
            "explanation": "This difference impacts feature selection; L1 tends to select fewer features while L2 shrinks all features.",
